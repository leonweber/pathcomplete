In this study, we show that E2F1 up-regulates axin2 by two independent mechanisms. The human axin2 gene allows transcription of messages with three different 5' untranslated regions and in the first mechanism E2F1 directly activates the transcription of only one of these species by acting at canonical E2F binding sites.

Here we investigate the mechanism of cellular activation by soluble peptidoglycan (sPGN) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), main stimulatory components of Gram-positive bacteria. Like LPS, sPGN and LTA bind to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein CD14 and induce activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in host cells like macrophages.

The sPGN- and LTA-induced NF-kappaB activation was not inhibited by polymyxin B, an antibiotic that binds and neutralizes LPS. Coexpression together with membrane CD14 enhances sPGN signal transmission through TLR2. In contrast to LPS signaling, activation of TLR2 by sPGN and LTA does not require serum.

J., and Conrad, H. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 356-365). Disaccharides prepared by cleavage of heparin and N-deacetylated chondroitin 6-sulfate with nitrous acid were used to demonstrate a new sulfatase that catalyzed the removal of the 2-O-sulfate substituents from GlcA but not IdoA residues. The deamination products were labeled by NaB3H4 reduction to give disaccharides from heparin and chondroitin sulfate which had reducing terminal 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol ([3H]AManR) and 2,5-anhydro-D-talitol ([3H]ATalR) residues, respectively. IdoA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4) from heparin and GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]ATalR(6-SO4) from chondroitin sulfate were purified for use as substrates. GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4) was prepared by epimerization of IdoA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4) with hydrazine at 100 degrees C.

In contrast, a lysosomal enzyme preparation from a human fibroblast cell line deficient in idurono-2-sulfatase (Hunter's-syndrome), which had no activity on the IdoA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4), converted GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4) to a mixture of GlcA-[3H] AManR(6-SO4) and [3H]AManR(6-SO4).

In zebrafish, Wnt signaling overcomes basal repression in the prospective caudal neurectoderm by Tcf homologs that act as inhibitors of Wnt target genes. The vertebrate homolog of Drosophila nemo, nemo-like kinase (Nlk), can phosphorylate Tcf/Lef proteins and inhibit the DNA-binding ability of beta-catenin/Tcf complexes, thereby blocking activation of Wnt targets. By contrast, mutations in a C. elegans homolog show that Nlk is required to activate Wnt targets that are constitutively repressed by Tcf. We show that overexpressed zebrafish nlk, in concert with wnt8, can downregulate two tcf3 homologs, tcf3a and tcf3b, that repress Wnt targets during neurectodermal patterning. Inhibition of nlk using morpholino oligos reveals essential roles in regulating ventrolateral mesoderm formation in conjunction with wnt8, and in patterning of the midbrain, possibly functioning with wnt8b. In both instances, nlk appears to function as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling.

We thus sought to identify native histone methyltransferase (HMT) activities from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we describe the biochemical purification and characterization of Set2, a novel HMT that is site-specific for lysine 36 (Lys36) of the H3 tail. Using an antiserum directed against Lys36 methylation in H3, we show that Set2, via its SET domain, is responsible for methylation at this site in vivo. Tethering of Set2 to a heterologous promoter reveals that Set2 represses transcription, and part of this repression is mediated through the HMT activity of the SET domain.

In this paper, we report that phosphatase of activated cells 1 (PAC1) phosphatase is a direct transcription target of E2F-1 in signaling apoptosis. We show that ectopic E2F-1 increases expression of PAC1 at both transcriptional and translational levels in breast cancer cells. E2F-1 physically interacts with the promoter of PAC1, binds to its consensus sequence in the promoter and transactivates the PAC1 promoter. E2F-1 suppresses extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation through PAC1 and causes cancer cell death by apoptosis following treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent N-4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (4-HPR). Furthermore, ectopic PAC1 inhibits ERK phosphorylation and mediates cell killing. Moreover, endogenous E2F-1 upregulates PAC1 and suppresses ERK activity, leading to cell death in response to 4-HPR. These results reveal a crucial role of PAC1 in E2F-1-directed apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that E2F-1 mediates apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of PAC1 and subsequent suppression of the ERK signaling.

With purified eIF-4E, using the same conditions, up to 0.1 mol of phosphate can be incorporated. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps show that the site phosphorylated in the Mr 25,000 subunit of eIF-4F (eIF-4F p25) is the same as that modified in purified eIF-4E.

Dephosphorylation of eIF-4F p25, previously phosphorylated with protein kinase C, occurs in reticulocyte lysate with a half-life of 15-20 min, whereas little dephosphorylation is observed after 15 min with the purified phosphorylated eIF-4E.

Aberrant signaling caused by altered Frizzled receptor activity or by mutations in downstream signaling components has been implicated in several adult pathologies. A diverse array of intracellular signaling pathways has been suggested to transduce the signals exerted in cells when secreted ligands of the Wnt family bind to Frizzled receptors. Studies with a chimeric receptor composed of Frizzled-2 and the beta2-adrenergic receptor have suggested that the binding of Wnt-5a to Frizzled-2 results in the activation of G proteins of the Galpha(i) family, the mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores and the induction of gene transcription through nuclear factor of activated T cells. In this report, we demonstrate by using beta-lactamase reporter gene technology that full-length, wild-type human Frizzled-2 does not couple to calcium-mediated signaling in HEK293 cells following stimulation with purified recombinant mouse Wnt-5a. In contrast, when stimulated with recombinant mouse Wnt-3a, Frizzled-2 activates the canonical Wnt/Frizzled signaling pathway, involving the transcriptional modulator beta-catenin. Our report underlines the importance of using cell lines stably overexpressing wild-type Frizzled receptors and the use of purified ligands when studying receptor pharmacology. This approach has allowed us to measure the half-maximal concentration for activation of human Frizzled-2 (1.5+/-0.4 nM; avg.+/-SD) and human Frizzled-1 (1.3+/-0.5 nM) following stimulation by Wnt-3a. Our results suggest that there is receptor redundancy with regard to Wnt-3a reception.

The present data support a role for p27 in the assembly of D-type cyclin-Cdk complexes and indicate that both cyclin D1-Cdk4-p27 assembly and kinase activation are regulated by p27 phosphorylation. Prior work showed that p27 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt) at T157 and T198. Here we show that PKB activation and the appearance of p27pT157 and p27pT198 precede p27-cyclin D1-Cdk4 assembly in early G(1). PI3K/PKB inhibition rapidly reduced p27pT157 and p27pT198 and dissociated cellular p27-cyclin D1-Cdk4. Mutant p27 allele products lacking phosphorylation at T157 and T198 bound poorly to cellular cyclin D1 and Cdk4. Cellular p27pT157 and p27pT198 coprecipitated with Cdk4 but were not detected in Cdk2 complexes. The addition of p27 to recombinant cyclin D1 and Cdk4 led to cyclin D1-Cdk4-p27 complex formation in vitro. p27 phosphorylation by PKB increased p27-cyclin D1-Cdk4 assembly in vitro but yielded inactive Cdk4. In contrast, Src pretreatment of p27 did not affect p27-cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex formation. However, Src treatment led to tyrosine phosphorylation of p27 and catalytic activation of assembled cyclin D1-Cdk4-p27 complexes. Thus, while PKB-dependent p27 phosphorylation appears to increase cyclin D1-Cdk4-p27 assembly or stabilize these complexes in vitro, cyclin D1-Cdk4-p27 activation requires the tyrosine phosphorylation of p27. Constitutive activation of PKB and Abl or Src family kinases in cancers would drive p27 phosphorylation, increase cyclin D1-Cdk4 assembly and activation, and reduce the cyclin E-Cdk2 inhibitory function of p27. Combined therapy with both Src and PI3K/PKB inhibitors may reverse this process."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event E2F", "id": "-5052310108272903856", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NPAT", "id": "-7494967856296855340", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NPAT", "id": "-1368308387268333565", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-4560730433710317402", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NPAT", "id": "-8277181273051696220", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-8122388091548661616", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-7823862713336197844", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NPAT", "id": "-4269814924474659766", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-3078057444236982727", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NPAT", "id": "-4349355927348271360", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NPAT", "id": "-2796692548087780764", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NPAT", "id": "-6011212873971124689", "answers": [{"text": 638, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 876, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 679, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 802, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 979, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 5, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 332, "answer_start": "transcription"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event histone", "id": "-5435322015251032589", "answers": [{"text": 1072, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 1389, "answer_start": "transcription"}, {"text": 189, "answer_start": "transcriptional activation"}, {"text": 1281, "answer_start": "transcription"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-5845972474682816008", "answers": [{"text": 529, "answer_start": "interact"}, {"text": 1328, "answer_start": "links"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-6467040722824615818", "answers": [{"text": 598, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "NPAT expression is regulated by E2F and is essential for cell cycle progression. \nNPAT is an in vivo substrate of cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase and is thought to play a critical role in coordinated transcriptional activation of histone genes during the G(1)/S-phase transition and in S-phase entry in mammalian cells. Here we show that NPAT transcription is up-regulated at the G(1)/S-phase boundary in growth-stimulated cells and that the NPAT promoter responds to activation by E2F proteins. We demonstrate that endogenous E2F proteins interact with the promoter of the NPAT gene in vivo and that induced expression of E2F1 stimulates NPAT mRNA expression, supporting the idea that the expression of NPAT is regulated by E2F. Consistently, we find that the E2F sites in the NPAT promoter are required for its activation during the G(1)/S-phase transition. Moreover, we show that the expression of NPAT accelerates S-phase entry in cells released from quiescence. The inhibition of NPAT expression by small interfering RNA duplexes impedes cell cycle progression and histone gene expression in tissue culture cells. Thus, NPAT is an important E2F target that is required for cell cycle progression in mammalian cells.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, calcineurin positively regulates transcription in response to stress by dephosphorylating the transcription factor Crz1p/Tcn1p. Dephosphorylation promotes Crz1p nuclear localization in part by increasing the efficiency of its nuclear import. In this work, we show that calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of Crz1p also down-regulates its nuclear export. Using a genetic approach, we identify Msn5p as the exportin for Crz1p. In addition, we define the Crz1p nuclear export signal (NES) and show that it interacts with Msn5p in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This indicates that calcineurin regulates Crz1p nuclear export by dephosphorylating and inactivating its NES. Finally, we define a motif in Crz1p, PIISIQ, similar to the PxIxIT docking site for calcineurin on the mammalian transcription factor NFAT, that mediates the in vivo interaction between calcineurin and Crz1p and is required for calcineurin-dependent regulation of Crz1p nuclear export and activity.

We have shown previously that purified eEF-2K can be phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and that this induces significant Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-independent eEF-2K activity [Redpath and Proud (1993) Biochem. J. 293, 31-34]. Furthermore, elevation of cAMP levels in adipocytes also increases the level of Ca(2+)/CaM-independent eEF-2K activity to a similar extent, providing a mechanistic link between elevated cAMP and the inhibition of protein synthesis [Diggle, Redpath, Heesom and Denton (1998) Biochem. J. 336, 525-529]. Here we describe the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-eEF-2K fusion protein and the identification of two serine residues that are phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. Endoproteinase Arg-C digestion of GST-eEF-2K produced two phosphopeptides that were separated by HPLC and sequenced. (32)P Radioactivity release from these peptides indicated that the sites of phosphorylation were Ser-365 and Ser-499, both of which lie C-terminal to the catalytic domain. Mutation of these sites to non-phosphorylatable residues indicated that both sites need to be phosphorylated to induce Ca(2+)/CaM-independent eEF-2K activity in vitro. However, expression of Myc-tagged eEF-2K in HEK 293 cells, followed by treatment with chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), showed that Ser-499 phosphorylation alone induced Ca(2+)/CaM-independent eEF-2K activity in cells. Co-expression of wild-type eEF-2K with luciferase resulted in a 2-3-fold reduction in luciferase expression. Expression of eEF-2K S499D resulted in a 10-fold reduction in luciferase expression despite the fact that this mutant was expressed at very low levels. This indicates that eEF-2K S499D is constitutively active when expressed in cells, thus leading to the suppression of its own expression. Our data demonstrate an important role for the phosphorylation of Ser-499 in the activation of eEF-2K by PKA and the inhibition of protein synthesis."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "8708047146569281086", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TSC1", "id": "-1263529626101342304", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TSC2", "id": "-695429342452734124", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "-5799276393547576185", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-4698089536105051004", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TCF", "id": "827706314604175521", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event LEF", "id": "3523827362004035422", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TSC2", "id": "8492441422963776813", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "5995032562740002167", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event tuberin", "id": "-7689736977657762375", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-819698072523997756", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event GSK3", "id": "6694706229794410854", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event GSK3", "id": "-1153102802937489702", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "4313035788370880173", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event GSK3", "id": "-8150550189168304913", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "6884417541697790239", "answers": [{"text": 210, "answer_start": "negative regulatory role"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Axin", "id": "2627894426478036344", "answers": [{"text": 927, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 395, "answer_start": "associates"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event GSK3", "id": "3802830964614349151", "answers": [{"text": 1150, "answer_start": "Inhibition"}, {"text": 1201, "answer_start": "association"}, {"text": 927, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 395, "answer_start": "associates"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "-6633572804461904617", "answers": [{"text": 605, "answer_start": "up-regulated"}, {"text": 451, "answer_start": "degradation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event cyclin D1", "id": "-8418873527952838425", "answers": [{"text": 605, "answer_start": "up-regulated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event connexin 43", "id": "2608292433950365415", "answers": [{"text": 605, "answer_start": "up-regulated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-2766199892586892860", "answers": [{"text": 905, "answer_start": "stimulation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Dishevelled", "id": "9141910119284040300", "answers": [{"text": 1030, "answer_start": "interaction"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event tuberin", "id": "-9089176758997659874", "answers": [{"text": 1030, "answer_start": "interaction"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TSC1", "id": "4016743681869988735", "answers": [{"text": 1250, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1522, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1288, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 1201, "answer_start": "association"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TSC2", "id": "-8860193547559267075", "answers": [{"text": 1288, "answer_start": "interaction"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Aberrant beta-catenin signaling in tuberous sclerosis. \nThe pathology associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) shows diverse phenotypes that suggest abnormal signaling of multiple pathways. Besides the negative regulatory role of the TSC1/TSC2 proteins on mTOR, we have reported an effect on beta-catenin signaling at the level of the degradation complex in vitro. The TSC1/TSC2 complex associates with GSK3 and Axin and promotes beta-catenin degradation to inhibit Wnt-stimulated TCF/LEF-dependent transcription. Here, we show that beta-catenin and its effectors, cyclin D1 and connexin 43, were up-regulated in TSC-related angiomyolipomas and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. This was supported by the failure of three disease-causing TSC2 missense mutants to inhibit Wnt signaling. Further, the interaction between TSC1/TSC2 and components of the beta-catenin degradation complex was dependent on Wnt stimulation such that binding of tuberin to GSK3 and Axin was reduced in the presence of Wnt whereas the tuberin-Dishevelled interaction was increased. GSK3 activity played a role in regulating the assembly/stability of the degradation complex. Inhibition of GSK3 by lithium chloride reduced its association with TSC1 whereas disruption of GSK3-phosphorylation sites in TSC1 reduced interaction between TSC2 and TSC1. Collectively, our data provide further evidence that beta-catenin signaling plays a role in TSC pathogenesis in vivo and suggest a novel role of GSK3 in modulating the TSC1/TSC2 complex through TSC1 phosphorylation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Arf", "id": "-959843350814780752", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F3", "id": "-1026346815047520082", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p16", "id": "-4577246860545152774", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ink4a", "id": "-3406736241644790965", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event pRB", "id": "1371864766726622524", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "4791538230169270277", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p19", "id": "-8169594291578377912", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Arf", "id": "8969110497017072280", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mdm2", "id": "821686364317352042", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "4512362906621390919", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "1283958597985749392", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "8219172483507124206", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F3", "id": "5477620626917795515", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "5375890086754102289", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F3b", "id": "4360845177826648718", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F3", "id": "-7832071991468515630", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "-7589657072629916979", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F3", "id": "-4239610258790122686", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p19", "id": "5922000895977667819", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Arf", "id": "-7777018869225162344", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "2532666243990980732", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Arf", "id": "-6901781181871939324", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "6013753690256214388", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2f3", "id": "-9014428491283614604", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2f3", "id": "8456291002402789947", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "5900031690108933961", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-7276400913941667987", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Arf", "id": "-4531823758134242587", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "1160504971121377217", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Arf", "id": "-7228538184177735699", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Arf", "id": "-1005624158096749615", "answers": [{"text": 459, "answer_start": "transcriptional"}, {"text": 708, "answer_start": "occupied"}, {"text": 1172, "answer_start": "loss"}, {"text": 1625, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 1600, "answer_start": "repression"}, {"text": 907, "answer_start": "derepress"}, {"text": 1408, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E2f3", "id": "3737552779481087420", "answers": [{"text": 885, "answer_start": "loss"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-3676987072386876156", "answers": [{"text": 1112, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 933, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Cip1", "id": "-3934447542029787495", "answers": [{"text": 1112, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 955, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-3132087564446244272", "answers": [{"text": 1452, "answer_start": "recruitment"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E2Fs", "id": "3445395403017382661", "answers": [{"text": 1452, "answer_start": "recruitment"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E2F3a", "id": "-433876538894114194", "answers": [{"text": 1452, "answer_start": "recruitment"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Repression of the Arf tumor suppressor by E2F3 is required for normal cell cycle kinetics. \nTumor development is dependent upon the inactivation of two key tumor-suppressor networks, p16(Ink4a)-cycD/cdk4-pRB-E2F and p19(Arf)-mdm2-p53, that regulate cellular proliferation and the tumor surveillance response. These networks are known to intersect with one another, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that E2F directly participates in the transcriptional control of Arf in both normal and transformed cells. This occurs in a manner that is significantly different from the regulation of classic E2F-responsive targets. In wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the Arf promoter is occupied by E2F3 and not other E2F family members. In quiescent cells, this role is largely fulfilled by E2F3b, an E2F3 isoform whose function was previously undetermined. E2f3 loss is sufficient to derepress Arf, triggering activation of p53 and expression of p21(Cip1). Thus, E2F3 is a key repressor of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway in normal cells. Consistent with this notion, Arf mutation suppresses the activation of p53 and p21(Cip1) in E2f3-deficient MEFs. Arf loss also rescues the known cell cycle re-entry defect of E2f3(-/-) cells, and this correlates with restoration of appropriate activation of classic E2F-responsive genes. Our data also demonstrate a direct role for E2F in the oncogenic activation of Arf. Specifically, we observe recruitment of the endogenous activating E2Fs, E2F1, and E2F3a, to the Arf promoter. Thus, distinct E2F complexes directly contribute to the normal repression and oncogenic activation of Arf.

Methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9) is widely associated with transcriptional silencing, and its disappearance is linked to the activation of several inflammatory genes by NF-kappaB. Here we describe that this event is controlled by a feed-forward circuit catalyzed by the activity of the histone demethylase Aof1 (also known as Lsd2/Kdm1b). We find that Aof1 is required for removal of dimethyl H3K9 at specific promoters, and thereby it controls stimulus-induced recruitment of NF-kappaB and gene expression. However, Aof1 is itself recruited by interaction with the c-Rel subunit of NF-kappaB, which is found at low levels associated with promoters in unstimulated cells.

Here we show that Cdc24, the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the yeast GTPase Cdc42, is sequestered in the cell nucleus by Far1. Export of Cdc24 to a site of cell polarization is mediated by two mechanisms. At bud emergence, activation of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28-Cln triggers degradation of Far1 and, as a result, relocation of Cdc24 to the cytoplasm. Cells overexpressing a non-degradable Far1 were unable to polarize their actin cytoskeleton because they failed to relocate Cdc24 to the incipient bud site. In contrast, in response to mating pheromones, the Far1-Cdc24 complex is exported from the nucleus by Msn5. This mechanism ensures that Cdc24 is targeted to the site of receptor-associated heterotrimeric G-protein activation at the plasma membrane, thereby allowing polarization of the actin cytoskeleton along the morphogenetic gradient of pheromone. Either degradation of Far1 or its nuclear export by Msn5 was sufficient for cell growth, suggesting that the two mechanisms are redundant for cell viability. Taken together, our results indicate that Far1 functions as a nuclear anchor for Cdc24. This sequestration regulates cell polarity in response to pheromones by restricting activation of Cdc42 to the site of pheromone receptor activation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Doc1", "id": "-3545345328644210221", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ubiquitin", "id": "4149884051019705065", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ubiquitin", "id": "3832983675456205371", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cyclin", "id": "143479694576639027", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Doc1", "id": "-2842706361781530603", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Apc10", "id": "988626301402860305", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Doc1", "id": "-1907977313179152230", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cyclin", "id": "-3112227219131727599", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Doc1", "id": "-5295778419925601537", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Doc1", "id": "6172648803657351356", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Doc1", "id": "-7361985575770386674", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ubiquitin", "id": "6953004306277496985", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cyclins", "id": "-4255189228653094200", "answers": [{"text": 195, "answer_start": "ubiquitination"}, {"text": 98, "answer_start": "proteolysis"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event securin", "id": "-480448152384799030", "answers": [{"text": 195, "answer_start": "ubiquitination"}, {"text": 98, "answer_start": "proteolysis"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The Doc1 subunit is a processivity factor for the anaphase-promoting complex. \nUbiquitin-mediated proteolysis of securin and mitotic cyclins is essential for exit from mitosis.

Using a well-defined in vitro system, we show that highly purified APC from Saccharomyces cerevisiae ubiquitinates a model cyclin substrate in a processive manner. Analysis of mutant APC lacking the Doc1/Apc10 subunit (APC(doc1 Delta)) indicates that Doc1 is required for processivity. The specific molecular defect in APC(doc1 Delta) is identified by a large increase in apparent K(M) for the cyclin substrate relative to the wild-type enzyme. This suggests that Doc1 stimulates processivity by limiting substrate dissociation. Addition of recombinant Doc1 to APC(doc1 Delta) fully restores enzyme function.

In contrast, Ace2 and Swi5 both bind in vivo to Ace2-only genes, such as CTS1, but promoter-bound Swi5 fails to activate. We show that activation by Swi5 is prevented by the binding of the Forkhead factors Fkh1 and Fkh2, which recruit the Rpd3(Large) histone deacetylase complex to the CTS1 promoter. Global analysis shows that all Ace2-only genes are bound by both Ace2 and Swi5, and also by Fkh1/2.

Unexpectedly, the Wnt antagonist Dkk2 is required for terminal osteoblast differentiation and mineralized matrix formation. We show that Dkk1, unlike Dkk2, negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. INTRODUCTION: The Wnt co-receptor LRP5 is a critical regulator of bone mass. Dickkopf (Dkk) proteins act as natural Wnt antagonists by bridging LRP5/6 and Kremen, inducing the internalization of the complex. Wnt antagonists are thus expected to negatively regulation bone formation. However, Dkk2 deficiency results in increased bone, questioning the precise role of Dkks in bone metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated specifically the role of Dkk1 in bone in vitro and in vivo. Using rat primary calvaria cells, we studied the effect of retroviral expression of Dkk1 on osteoblast differentiation. In addition, the effect of Dkk1 osteoblast was studied in MC3T3-E1 cells by means of recombinant protein. Finally, to address the role of Dkk1 in vivo, we analyzed the bone phenotype of Dkk1(+/-) animals. RESULTS: Retroviral expression of Dkk1 in rat primary calvaria cells resulted in a complete inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and formation of mineralized nodules, with a marked decrease in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. Dkk1 expression also increased adipocyte differentiation in these cell cultures. Recombinant murine Dkk1 (rmDkk1) inhibited spontaneous and induced osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. To determine the role of Dkk1 in vivo and overcome the embryonic lethality of homozygous deletion, we studied the bone phenotype in heterozygous Dkk1-deficient mice. Structural, dynamic, and cellular analysis of bone remodeling in Dkk1(+/-) mice showed an increase in all bone formation parameters, with no change in bone resorption, leading to a marked increase in bone mass.

The enzymes that mediate synthesis are the phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3-Ks) that form a family of structurally diverse enzymes with distinct substrate specificities. In this paper, we describe the cloning of a novel human PI3-K, namely PI3-K-C2 alpha, which contains a C-terminal C2 domain. This enzyme can be assigned to the class II PI3-Ks, which was defined by characterization of the Drosophila 68D enzyme and includes the recently described murine enzymes m-cpk and p170. Despite the overall similarity in the amino acid sequence of the murine and human enzymes, which suggests that they are encoded by closely related genes, these molecules show marked sequence heterogeneity at their N-termini. Biochemical analysis of recombinant PI3-K-C2 alpha demonstrates a restricted lipid substrate specificity. As reported for other members of this class, the enzyme only phosphorylates PtdIns and PtdIns4P when the lipids are presented alone. However, when lipids were presented together with phosphatidylserine acting as a carrier, phosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was also observed. The catalytic activity of PI3-K-C2 alpha is refractory to concentrations of wortmannin and LY294002 which inhibit the PI3-K activity of other family members. The comparative insensitivity of PI3-K-C2 alpha to these inhibitors suggests that their use should be reevaluated in the study of PI3-Ks."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Cdc42Hs", "id": "867668542974329506", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ras", "id": "-3923467983296957793", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cdc42", "id": "5587797758126224981", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cdc42Hs", "id": "-5052293449323104399", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p85", "id": "8350808954612320294", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PI 3-kinase", "id": "1671562253767084620", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p85", "id": "7946216872497737135", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event GST-Cdc42HsT35A", "id": "3702845696593967250", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho-GAP", "id": "3176798775088253993", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p85", "id": "-1775823261837660698", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cdc42Hs-GAP", "id": "-5520055507555844338", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cdc42Hs", "id": "4013252737254748996", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p85", "id": "8573679118348748632", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PI 3-kinase", "id": "636786244977860911", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho-GAP", "id": "-5680171774639167955", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p85", "id": "-6152640908949359223", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p85", "id": "655479291396552557", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cdc42Hs", "id": "347261233593113263", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rac1", "id": "-1292132066682062191", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event phosphoinositide 3-kinase", "id": "3593835743633216732", "answers": [{"text": 0, "answer_start": "Activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p85", "id": "6583255943617862919", "answers": [{"text": 60, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1207, "answer_start": "interactions"}, {"text": 1016, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cdc42Hs", "id": "-7059362587088866712", "answers": [{"text": 495, "answer_start": "bound"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase", "id": "1104465951508779027", "answers": [{"text": 558, "answer_start": "association"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event GST-Cdc42Hs", "id": "-7857497950041541390", "answers": [{"text": 704, "answer_start": "bound"}, {"text": 773, "answer_start": "bound"}, {"text": 739, "answer_start": "formed a complex"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PI 3-kinase", "id": "3970463371411000970", "answers": [{"text": 1153, "answer_start": "stimulated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Cdc42Hs", "id": "-1491055719000160622", "answers": [{"text": 1406, "answer_start": "couple"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity by Cdc42Hs binding to p85. \nThe Ras-like GTPase Cdc42 is essential for cell polarity and bud site assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by regulating cell cycle-dependent reorganization of cortical cytoskeletal elements.

NF-kappaB is found in essentially all cell types and is involved in activation of an exceptionally large number of genes in response to infections, inflammation, and other stressful situations requiring rapid reprogramming of gene expression. NF-kappaB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells and consequently must be translocated into the nucleus to function. The subcellular location of NF-kappaB is controlled by a family of inhibitory proteins, IkappaBs, which bind NF-kappaB and mask its nuclear localization signal, thereby preventing nuclear uptake. Exposure of cells to a variety of extracellular stimuli leads to the rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately proteolytic degradation of IkappaB, which frees NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription. NF-kappaB activation represents a paradigm for controlling the function of a regulatory protein via ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis, as an integral part of a phosphorylationbased signaling cascade. Recently, considerable progress has been made in understanding the details of the signaling pathways that regulate NF-kappaB activity, particularly those responding to the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1. The multisubunit IkappaB kinase (IKK) responsible for inducible IkappaB phosphorylation is the point of convergence for most NF-kappaB-activating stimuli. IKK contains two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, both of which are able to correctly phosphorylate IkappaB. Gene knockout studies have shed light on the very different physiological functions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta. After phosphorylation, the IKK phosphoacceptor sites on IkappaB serve as an essential part of a specific recognition site for E3RS(IkappaB/beta-TrCP), an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby explaining how IKK controls IkappaB ubiquitination and degradation. A variety of other signaling events, including phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, hyperphosphorylation of IKK, induction of IkappaB synthesis, and the processing of NF-kappaB precursors, provide additional mechanisms that modulate the level and duration of NF-kappaB activity."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event phospholipase A2", "id": "-1185926316471175585", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cytosolic phospholipase A2", "id": "8068665706672379765", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event phospholipase C delta 1", "id": "6689309788164677386", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cPLA2", "id": "-747437837211339951", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein kinase C", "id": "-3810612884198527866", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event synaptotagmins", "id": "8119104544331649918", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cPLA2", "id": "4753472669960999766", "answers": [{"text": 361, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 469, "answer_start": "translocation"}, {"text": 1139, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 141, "answer_start": "sensitive"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Crystal structure of a calcium-phospholipid binding domain from cytosolic phospholipase A2. \nCytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is a calcium-sensitive 85-kDa enzyme that hydrolyzes arachidonic acid-containing membrane phospholipids to initiate the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor, potent inflammatory mediators.

We then show that nuclear entry of MAPK through a nuclear pore occurs via two distinct mechanisms. Nuclear import of wild-type MAPK (mol. wt 42 kDa) was induced by activation of the MAPK pathway even in the presence of wheat germ agglutinin or dominant-negative Ran, whereas nuclear import of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal)-fused MAPK (mol. wt 160 kDa), which occurred in response to stimuli, was completely blocked by these inhibitors. Moreover, while a dimerization-deficient mutant of MAPK was able to translocate to the nucleus upon stimulation, this mutant MAPK, when fused to beta-gal, became unable to enter the nucleus.

To clarify these additional functions of NBS1, we generated NBS cell lines stably expressing various NBS1 mutants from retroviral vectors.

The defects in ATM-dependent activation of CHK2, S phase checkpoint control, IR-induced nuclear focus formation, and radiation sensitivity apparent in NBS cells were not corrected by expression of NBS1 mutants that lack an intact MRE11 binding domain, suggesting that formation of the NBS1-MRE11-RAD50 complex is required for the corresponding normal phenotypes.

maturation and type 1 response of dendritic cell. \nPorin of Shigella dysenteriae was incorporated in liposome (PIL) and presented to mouse splenic dendritic cells (DC). PIL up-regulated Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR6 on DC, showing that co-expression of the two TLRs is involved in recognition of porin. Detection of myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88)-TLR2 complex confirmed interaction between the two for triggering the downstream signaling, which ultimately led to TLR2-dependent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B. PIL-induced expression of MHC class II (I-Ab), CD40 and CD80 showed maturation of DC, whereas up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and CCR7 implicated the capacity of splenic DC to migrate. Induction of messenger ribonucleic acid for the chemokines, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted indicated a strong bias of PIL for type 1 polarization that was supported by the intracellular expression and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-12. Along with CD40 and CD80 expression, release of the cytokines of CD11c+ JAWS II cells was inhibited by TLR2 or simultaneous TLR2 and 6 knockdown showing that recognition of PIL by the two TLRs is essential for DC activation and type 1 polarization. The signaling pathway initiated upon recognition of PIL by the TLRs was MyD88 dependent as confirmed by inhibition of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-12 release of MyD88-knockdown JAWS II cells. The maturation and polarization of DC induced T(h)1 phenotype, as evident from proliferation, activation and IFN-gamma release of allogeneic CD4+ T cells in response to PIL-stimulated DC, thereby suggesting that the adjuvant activity of PIL can successfully bridge the innate and adaptive immunity."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event MAO A", "id": "5641385895482138455", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event B", "id": "-6569687677770248623", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAO (monoamine oxidase) A", "id": "1648158434444845405", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event B", "id": "-7815697582659750212", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAO A", "id": "8314549119848111843", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAO B", "id": "5641912190663408631", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAO B", "id": "1859897662963722029", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAO A", "id": "-3225603516825314916", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event B", "id": "6104337427653374879", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAO A", "id": "-6708880988917967069", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event B", "id": "934823764999497131", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAO A", "id": "-7451489344851349032", "answers": [{"text": 708, "answer_start": "deletion"}, {"text": 499, "answer_start": "knock-out"}, {"text": 599, "answer_start": "KO"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event B", "id": "5191433498542940917", "answers": [{"text": 499, "answer_start": "knock-out"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Role of MAO A and B in neurotransmitter metabolism and behavior. \nMAO (monoamine oxidase) A and B are key isoenzymes that degrade biogenic and dietary amines.

However, the substrate specificity overlap and the in vivo function of these two isoenzymes is not clear. Recently, we have shown that MAO A and B knock-out (KO) mice exhibit distinct differences in neurotransmitter metabolism and behavior. MAO A KO mice have elevated brain levels of 5-HT, NE and DA and manifest aggressive behavior similar to men with a deletion of MAO A. In contrast, MAO B KO mice do not exhibit aggression and only levels of PEA are increased. Both MAO A and B KO mice show increased reactivity to stress.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites. Here we show that amino acids regulate the N-terminal phosphorylation sites in 4E-BP1 through the RAIP motif in a rapamycin-insensitive manner. Several criteria indicate this reflects a rapamycin-insensitive output from mTOR. In contrast, the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the C-terminal site Ser64/65 is generally sensitive to rapamycin, as is phosphorylation of another well-characterized target for mTOR signaling, S6K1. Our data imply that it is unlikely that mTOR directly phosphorylates Thr69/70 in 4E-BP1. Although 4E-BP1 and S6K1 bind the mTOR partner, raptor, our data indicate that the outputs from mTOR to 4E-BP1 and S6K1 are distinct. In cells, efficient phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 requires it to be able to bind to eIF4E, whereas phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR in vitro shows no such preference.

The NFkappaB family of transcription factors responds to inflammatory cytokines with rapid transcriptional activation, in which NFkappaB enters the nucleus and binds DNA.

This is accomplished in part by maintaining the Cdc25 phosphatase in a phosphorylated form that binds 14-3-3 proteins. Here we report that 14-3-3 binding regulates the intracellular trafficking of Cdc25C. Although primarily cytoplasmic, Cdc25C accumulated in the nuclei of leptomycin B (LMB)-treated cells, indicating that Cdc25C is actively exported out of the nucleus. A mutant of Cdc25C that is unable to bind 14-3-3 was partially nuclear in the absence of LMB and its nuclear accumulation was greatly enhanced by LMB-treatment. A nuclear export signal (NES) was identified within the amino terminus of Cdc25C. Although mutation of the NES did not effect 14-3-3 binding, it did cause nuclear accumulation of Cdc25C. These results demonstrate that 14-3-3 binding is dispensable for the nuclear export of Cdc25C. However, complete nuclear accumulation of Cdc25C required loss of both NES function and 14-3-3 binding and this was accomplished both pharmacologically and by mutation.

Following exposure to diverse pro-inflammatory signals (e.g. TNF alpha, IL1, LPS) various signal transduction cascades are initiated converging on the I kappa B kinase (IKK). IKK phosphorylates I kappa B alpha on serines 32 and 36 signaling the inhibitory protein for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The SCF beta-TRCP complex is the ubiquitin ligase responsible for mediating phosphorylation dependent ubiquitination of I kappa B alpha. Here we reconstitute phosphorylation dependent ubiquitination of I kappa B alpha using recombinant components. Our results suggest that the cullin specificity of the SCF complex may reflect its ability to associate with Rbx1. We demonstrate specific ubiquitination of I kappa B alpha by Ubc3 and Ubc4 in a phosphorylation and SCF beta-TRCP dependent manner and that both are capable of associating with the SCF beta-TRCP complex isolated from human cells. Finally, we show that Ubc4 is in excess to Ubc3 in THP.1 cells and 19 times more efficient in catalyzing the reaction, suggesting that Ubc4 is the preferentially used Ubc in this reaction in vivo.

In this study, we have investigated the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor on type I collagen expression in adult normal human (ANF) and scleroderma (SF) fibroblasts. We demonstrated that NF-kappaB, a master transcription factor playing a major role in immune response/apoptosis, down-regulates COL1A1 expression by a transcriptional control involving the -112/-61 bp sequence. This 51-bp region mediates the action of two zinc fingers, Sp1 (specific protein-1) and Sp3, acting as trans-activators of type I collagen expression in ANF and SF. Knockdown of each one of these trans factors by siRNA confirmed the trans-activating effect of Sp1/Sp3 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB trans-inhibiting effect on COL1A1 expression. Despite no existing kappaB consensus sequence in the COL1A1 promoter, we found that Sp1/Sp3/c-Krox and NF-kappaB bind and/or are recruited on the proximal promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Attempts to elucidate whether interactions between Sp1/Sp3/c-Krox and p65 are necessary to mediate the NF-kappaB inhibitory effect on COL1A1 in ANF and SF were carried out; in this regard, immunoprecipitation assays revealed that they interact, and this was validated by re-ChIP. Finally, the knockdown of Sp1/Sp3/c-Krox prevents the p65 inhibitory effect on COL1A1 transcription in ANF, whereas only the siRNAs targeting Sp3 and c-Krox provoked the same effect in SF, suggesting that particular interactions are characteristic of the scleroderma phenotype.

The critical target of SCF(Met30) is the transcription factor Met4, as deletion of MET4 suppresses the lethality of met30 mutants. Surprisingly, Met4 is a relatively stable protein and its abundance is not influenced by Met30.

Their protein products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, form a functional complex that affects cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. Several lines of evidence, including renal tumors derived from TSC2+/- animals, suggest that the loss or inhibition of tuberin is associated with up-regulation of cyclin D1. As cyclin D1 can be regulated through the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, we hypothesize that the cell proliferative effects of hamartin and tuberin are partly mediated through beta-catenin. In this study, total beta-catenin protein levels were found to be elevated in the TSC2-related renal tumors. Ectopic expression of hamartin and wild-type tuberin, but not mutant tuberin, reduced beta-catenin steady-state levels and its half-life. The TSC1-TSC2 complex also inhibited Wnt-1 stimulated Tcf/LEF luciferase reporter activity. This inhibition was eliminated by constitutively active beta-catenin but not by Disheveled, suggesting that hamartin and tuberin function at the level of the beta-catenin degradation complex. Indeed, hamartin and tuberin co-immunoprecipitated with glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and Axin, components of this complex in a Wnt-1-dependent manner.

To determine the roles of this complex in the cell cycle regulation and transformation, we have examined the composition of this complex. We report here that this complex contained an additional protein, human CUL-1, a member of the cullin/CDC53 family. The identification of CUL-1 as a member of the complex raises the possibility that the p19(SKP1)/p45(SKP2)/CUL-1 complex may function as the yeast SKP1-CDC53-F-box (SCF) protein complex that acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase to regulate the G1/S transition. In mammalian cells, cyclin D, p21(CIP1/WAF1), and p27(KIP1) are short-lived proteins that are controlled by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. To determine the potential in vivo targets of the p19(SKP1)/p45(SKP2)/CUL-1 complex, we have used the specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against either SKP1, SKP2, or CUL-1 RNA to inhibit their expression. Treatment of cells with these oligonucleotides caused the selective accumulation of p21 and cyclin D proteins. The protein level of p27 was not affected. These data suggest that the human p19(SKP1)/p45(SKP2)/CUL-1 complex is likely to function as an E3 ligase to selectively target cyclin D and p21 for the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.

Exposure to chlorambucil, fludarabine, and Nutlin-3 induced p53 accumulation and variably affected cell cycle progression in SKW6.4 lymphoblastoid cells.

On the other hand, recombinant TRAIL alone did not affect cell cycle progression but induced a rapid increase of apoptosis. Analysis of the gene expression profile of the p53-transcriptional targets showed distinct features between chlorambucil, Nutlin-3 and fludarabine, which likely account for their differential effect on cell cycle in SKW6.4 cells.

The terminal components of this cascade, two PGE(2) synthases (PGES), have very recently been identified as glutathione-dependent proteins. cPGES is cytoplasmic, apparently identical to the hsp90 chaperone, p23, and associates functionally with prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase-1 (PGHS-1), the constitutive cyclooxygenase. A second synthase, designated mPGES, is microsomal and can be regulated. Here we demonstrate that mPGES and PGHS-2 are expressed at very low levels in untreated human orbital fibroblasts. Interleukin (IL)-1beta treatment elicits high levels of PGHS-2 and mPGES expression. The induction of both enzymes occurs at the pretranslational level, is the consequence of enhanced gene promoter activities, and can be blocked by dexamethasone (10 nm). SC58125, a PGHS-2-selective inhibitor, could attenuate the induction of mPGES, suggesting a dependence of this enzyme on PGHS-2 activity. IL-1beta treatment activates p38 and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases.

Here we demonstrate that the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1)-dependent phosphorylation of securin near its destruction-box motif inhibits securin ubiquitination by the APC. The phosphatase Cdc14 reverses securin phosphorylation, thereby increasing the rate of securin ubiquitination. Because separase is known to activate Cdc14 (refs 5 and 6), our results support the existence of a positive feedback loop that increases the abruptness of anaphase. Consistent with this model, we show that mutations that disrupt securin phosphoregulation decrease the synchrony of chromosome segregation.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of the NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) on the expression of MMPs in IL-1beta-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) of rheumatoid arthritis patients. FLSs were treated with IL-1beta (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in the presence or absence of PDTC. The level of MMP-1 and MMP-13 increased in response to PDTC in time- and dose-dependent manners in IL-1beta-stimulated FLSs; the expressions of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) decreased in a PDTC concentration-dependent manner. However, PDTC-mediated repression of IL-6 and VEGF expression was not observed in TNF-alpha-stimulated rheumatoid arthritis FLSs. In contrast, other NF-kappaB inhibitors, such as fenofibrate, N-acetylcysteine and MG132, decreased MMP expression in IL-1beta-stimulated FLSs. The stimulatory effect of PDTC on MMP expression was not mimicked by specific inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Treatments with 100 muM PDTC did not inhibit the phosphorylation of p-ERK1/2, p-P38, and p-JNK, or the transnuclear migration of NF-kappaB through degradation of IkappaB-alpha in IL-1beta-stimulated FLSs. These results suggest that the increase of MMP expression may occur in a stimuli-specific manner or by an NF-kappaB independent mechanism.

Cdc7 kinase activity fluctuates during cell cycle, and this is mainly the result of oscillation of expression of the Dbf4 subunit. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of regulation of Dbf4 expression. We have isolated and characterized the promoter region of the human ASK gene encoding Dbf4-related regulatory subunit for human Cdc7 kinase. We have identified a 63-base pair ASK promoter segment, which is sufficient for mediating growth stimulation. This minimal promoter segment (MP), containing an Sp1 site but no canonical E2F site, can be activated by ectopic E2F expression as well. Within the 63-base pair region, the Sp1 site as well as other elements are essential for stimulation by growth signals and by E2F, whereas an AT-rich sequence proximal to the coding region may serve as an element required for suppression in quiescence. Gel shift assays in the presence of an antibody demonstrate the presence of E2F1 in the protein-DNA complexes generated on the MP segment. However, the complex formation on MP was not competed by a DHFR promoter fragment, known to bind to E2F, nor by a consensus E2F binding oligonucleotide.

The ABIN proteins were therefore proposed to mediate the NF-kappa B inhibiting function of A20. Here we demonstrate the presence of a short homologous region in ABINs and I kappa B kinase gamma, the regulatory subunit of the I kappa B kinase complex. Site-specific mutagenesis of this region abolished the NF-kappa B inhibiting function of ABIN-1, without affecting the interaction with A20. Furthermore, coexpression of these ABIN-1 mutants interfered in a dominant negative manner with the NF-kappa B inhibiting function of ABIN-1, whereas the A20-mediated inhibition was unaffected. These results suggest that A20 and ABIN-1 probably act independently of their mutual interaction."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases", "id": "8287490869055023360", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP kinase", "id": "2934835078728479869", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event P38gamma", "id": "524493463233474983", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event P38alpha", "id": "-3226625510044073118", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP kinase", "id": "-2901967397292353506", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event P38gamma", "id": "-1066518994172136768", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event P38gamma", "id": "2612982739894566519", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ERK2", "id": "-7668630514073503068", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event P38gamma", "id": "-6142623594521149904", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p38gamma", "id": "-5701430355641489094", "answers": [{"text": 17, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event P38gamma", "id": "-4152518351207694211", "answers": [{"text": 700, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}, {"text": 321, "answer_start": "expressed"}, {"text": 727, "answer_start": "complex"}, {"text": 1246, "answer_start": "activated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event P38alpha MAP kinase", "id": "5565061026019004448", "answers": [{"text": 511, "answer_start": "inactive"}, {"text": 493, "answer_start": "unphosphorylated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event ERK2", "id": "298915811940526625", "answers": [{"text": 1151, "answer_start": "activated"}, {"text": 548, "answer_start": "unphosphorylated"}, {"text": 601, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event P38", "id": "-4413693838454219632", "answers": [{"text": 826, "answer_start": "activated"}, {"text": 879, "answer_start": "bound"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MAP kinases", "id": "6134762013378161325", "answers": [{"text": 1618, "answer_start": "form dimers"}, {"text": 1561, "answer_start": "activated"}, {"text": 1596, "answer_start": "activated"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The structure of phosphorylated p38gamma is monomeric and reveals a conserved activation-loop conformation. \nBACKGROUND: Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases mediate the cellular response to stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress. P38gamma is a new member of the MAP kinase family, and is expressed at its highest levels in skeletal muscle. P38gamma is 63% identical in sequence to P38alpha. The structure of P38alpha MAP kinase has been determined in the apo, unphosphorylated, inactive form. The structures of apo unphosphorylated ERK2, a related MAP kinase, and apo phosphorylated ERK2 have also been determined. RESULTS: We have determined the structure of doubly phosphorylated P38gamma in complex with an ATP analog by X-ray crystallography. This is the first report of a structure of an activated kinase in the P38 subfamily, and the first bound to a nucleotide. P38gamma residue phosphoryl-Thr183 forms hydrogen bonds with five basic amino acids, and these interactions induce an interdomain rotation. The conformation of the activation loop of P38gamma is almost identical to that observed in the structure of activated ERK2. However, unlike ERK2, the crystal structure and solution studies indicate that activated P38gamma exists as a monomer. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions mediated by phosphoryl-Thr183 induce structural changes that direct the domains and active-site residues of P38gamma into a conformation consistent with catalytic activity. The conformation of the phosphorylation loop is likely to be similar in all activated MAP kinases, but not all activated MAP kinases form dimers."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Toll-like receptor (TLR)2", "id": "5542171142837543167", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-1085672998826293327", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll-like receptors", "id": "4184814262721158837", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLRs", "id": "2457238694354556692", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR", "id": "8401878294956026366", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR", "id": "7150760946090571731", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "3277380344299208599", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event sTLR2", "id": "-9083800938967760505", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event sTLR2", "id": "-6191399609245738619", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event sTLR2", "id": "6866874994620791288", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-6538424609207537697", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event c-myc", "id": "1186840761184378301", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event sTLR2", "id": "-9027586258259150095", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-5267990147308745075", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event sTLR2", "id": "-7011001422416874095", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event sTLR2", "id": "-4860596024785024709", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR", "id": "-1557390472693988720", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event CD14", "id": "2190244398218672481", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event sTLR2", "id": "-2041330148375726243", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event CD14", "id": "7647511554375886983", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR", "id": "6054650427522850835", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-2263897204267880881", "answers": [{"text": 589, "answer_start": "active"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event sTLR2", "id": "2729267437790448972", "answers": [{"text": 1268, "answer_start": "Depletion"}, {"text": 1162, "answer_start": "expressed"}, {"text": 1512, "answer_start": "interaction"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Soluble forms of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 capable of modulating TLR2 signaling are present in human plasma and breast milk. \nDysregulation of the initial, innate immune response to bacterial infection may lead to septic shock and death.

We have therefore sought specific regulatory mechanisms that may modulate TLR signaling. In this study, we tested for the possible existence of a functionally active soluble form of TLR2. We demonstrated the existence of natural soluble forms of TLR2 (sTLR2), which we show to be capable of modulating cell activation. We found that blood monocytes released sTLR2 constitutively and that the kinetics of sTLR2 release increased upon cell activation. Analysis of cells expressing the human TLR2 cDNA or its c-myc-tagged version indicated that sTLR2 resulted from the posttranslational modification of the TLR2 protein in an intracellular compartment. Moreover, an intracellular pool of sTLR2 is maintained. sTLR2 was found naturally expressed in breast milk and plasma. Milk sTLR2 levels mirrored those of the TLR coreceptor soluble CD14. Depletion of sTLR2 from serum resulted in an increased cellular response to bacterial lipopeptide. Notably, serum sTLR2 was lower in tuberculosis patients. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and computational molecular docking studies showed an interaction between sTLR2 and soluble CD14 in plasma and milk.

Recently it was shown that the amino terminus of Raf-1 contains an autoregulatory domain that can inhibit its activity in Xenopus oocytes. In the present work we show that expression of the Raf-1 autoinhibitory domain blocks extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 activation by the Raf-1 catalytic domain in mammalian cells. We also show that phosphorylation of Raf-1 on serine 338 by PAK1 and tyrosines 340 and 341 by Src relieves autoinhibition and that this occurs through a specific decrease in the binding of the Raf-1 regulatory domain to its catalytic domain. In addition, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of threonine 491 and serine 494, two phosphorylation sites in the catalytic domain that are required for Raf-1 activation, is unlikely to regulate autoinhibition.

In contrast, MyD88(S) behaves as a dominant-negative inhibitor of IL-1- and LPS-, but not TNF-induced, NF-kappaB activation. These results implicate the ID of MyD88 in the phosphorylation of IRAK. Moreover, the regulated expression and antagonistic activity of MyD88(S) suggest an important role for alternative splicing of MyD88 in the regulation of the cellular response to IL-1 and LPS."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event TLR4", "id": "3757738094294982142", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IRF-3", "id": "-7511283837068279750", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 7", "id": "8779195267234543611", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAM", "id": "-2413647936994166788", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRIF", "id": "-5216354724963222459", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll-IL-1-resistance (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-beta (TRIF)-related adaptor molecule", "id": "-1556184367917728776", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAM", "id": "-1076363191743286040", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TIR", "id": "4179882417570418570", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll receptor", "id": "5889408680792644855", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRIF", "id": "3769818935077320256", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAM", "id": "1981097104527008962", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3", "id": "-273463348223656642", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IRF-7", "id": "-1053134044373204974", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll-like receptor (TLR)3", "id": "6011339490515887185", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 4", "id": "-1753373002515222178", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted", "id": "8091157929319704932", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IP-10", "id": "2990920759622716301", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event myeloid differentiation factor 88", "id": "5404487389454310730", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MyD88", "id": "3114682864909202914", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRIF", "id": "-1147581193040922213", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR3", "id": "5541504020434498536", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR4", "id": "-6163078865218067396", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAM", "id": "-4719841511978373738", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR4", "id": "-4360761722692354604", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MyD88 adaptor-like protein", "id": "-7015558201479461365", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TIRAP", "id": "1258775968289077257", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR3", "id": "6610651662738209127", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRIF", "id": "-6033694332361764279", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAM", "id": "5134217384571472756", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR4", "id": "-8226019811011296603", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MyD88", "id": "-5711764468701003613", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event gamma interferon-inducible protein 10", "id": "-5239838352938101477", "answers": [{"text": 630, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event IFN-alpha/beta", "id": "-8769510702412683025", "answers": [{"text": 630, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event RANTES", "id": "2154368562134433088", "answers": [{"text": 630, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TRIF", "id": "-125181260798069571", "answers": [{"text": 944, "answer_start": "interacts"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TRAM", "id": "1582225296385146389", "answers": [{"text": 944, "answer_start": "interacts"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Mal", "id": "4927090365750532960", "answers": [{"text": 944, "answer_start": "interacts"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TLR4", "id": "-6636469707153888193", "answers": [{"text": 944, "answer_start": "interacts"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LPS-TLR4 signaling to IRF-3/7 and NF-kappaB involves the toll adapters TRAM and TRIF. \nToll-IL-1-resistance (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-beta (TRIF)-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) is the fourth TIR domain-containing adaptor protein to be described that participates in Toll receptor signaling.

However, the heparan sulfates modified by 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A, isoforms of 3-OST-1, do not have anticoagulant activity, although these isoforms transfer sulfate to the 3-OH position of glucosamine residues. In this study, we characterize the substrate specificity of purified 3-OST-3A at the tetrasaccharide level. The 3-OST-3A enzyme was purified from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing 3-OST-3A cDNA. Two 3-OST-3A-modified tetrasaccharides were purified from the 3-O-(35)S-sulfated heparan sulfate that was digested by heparin lyases. These tetrasaccharides were analyzed using nitrous acid and enzymatic degradation combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry.

Ectopic expression of E2F1 protein was found to increase E2F6 mRNA levels and significantly upregulate E2F6 promoter activity. Deletion or mutation of the putative E2F binding sites nullified the effects of E2F1 on the E2F6 promoter activity. Studies on the temporal induction of E2F family members demonstrated that the activating E2Fs, and most notably E2F1, were upregulated before E2F6 during cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase, and this coincided with the time course of induction experienced by the E2F6 promoter during the course of the cell cycle. EMSAs indicated the specific binding of nuclear complexes to the E2F6 promoter that contained E2F1-related species whose binding was specifically competed by the consensus E2F binding site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with anti-E2Fs demonstrated the association of E2F family members with the E2F6 promoter in vivo.

Our results showed that suppression of PAG608 using transient and stable transfection with PAG608 antisense cDNA or small interfering RNA attenuates methamphetamine-induced death of various monoaminergic neuronal cells, suggesting that methamphetamine neurotoxicity in monoaminergic cells is related, at least in part, to induction of PAG608 expression."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event alpha3", "id": "1444730073273752990", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta1", "id": "7617624311969368679", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Na+-Ca++ exchanger", "id": "-6606153071729548293", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Na+-Ca++ exchangers", "id": "7651551817143753085", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Na+-Ca++ exchanger", "id": "-6381068041205379928", "answers": [{"text": 9, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Na+-Ca++ exchangers", "id": "4141018314079673755", "answers": [{"text": 391, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 537, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 692, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event beta1", "id": "-2168051197689323533", "answers": [{"text": 692, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Na,K-ATPase alpha1", "id": "7037935451514663413", "answers": [{"text": 692, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event alpha2", "id": "1562361361615188899", "answers": [{"text": 692, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event alpha3", "id": "-5097791245560633226", "answers": [{"text": 692, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Na,K-ATPase beta2", "id": "-6863290689981235110", "answers": [{"text": 807, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Regional expression of sodium pump subunits isoforms and Na+-Ca++ exchanger in the human heart. \nCardiac glycosides exert a positive inotropic effect by inhibiting sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase) activity, decreasing the driving force for Na+-Ca++ exchange, and increasing cellular content and release of Ca++ during depolarization.

The G1/S transition is orchestrated by the transcription factor E2F. E2F controls the expression of a group of checkpoint genes whose products are required either for the G1-to-S transition itself or for DNA replication (e.g. DNA polymerase alpha). E2F activity is repressed in growth-arrested cells and in early G1, and is activated at mid-to-late G1. E2F is controlled by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb. Rb represses E2F mainly by recruiting chromatin remodeling factors (histone deacetylases and SWI/SNF complexes), the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, and a histone methyltransferase. This review will focus on the molecular mechanisms of E2F repression by Rb during the cell cycle and during cell-cycle exit by differentiating cells.

Activity determination and immunoblot analysis of DAC in human target tissues for arylamine carcinogens revealed that in extrahepatic tissues, additional enzymes are responsible for any deacetylation activity, whereas a single enzyme predominantly catalyzes this hydrolytic reaction in liver.

This clone encodes an open reading frame of 400 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 45.7 kDa and contains two putative glycosylation sites. The 3'-untranslated region contains two putative polyadenylation signals. The cDNA was confirmed to be that for DAC in tryptic peptides from the purified human liver protein. Highest sequence similarity of DAC was found in a series of prokaryotic esterases encompassing the putative active site. Two extended regions of significant sequence homology with hormone-sensitive lipase and with lipase 2 from Moraxella TA144 were identified, whereas similarity to carboxyl esterases was restricted to the region encompassing the putative active site, indicating that DAC should be classified as esterase.

In this study, three anti-PML adamantyl-conjugated peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers previously described as in vitro inhibitors of PML/RARalpha translation were combined and used to block PML/RARalpha synthesis in NB4 cells. Cationic liposomes were used to achieve sufficient delivery of PNAs into the cells. Upon treatment of cells with the liposome/PNA mixture, enhanced cellular uptake of PNA (approximately 5-fold compared with control) was obtained. Concomitantly, a substantial reduction (>90%) of the expression of PML/RARalpha was observed when all of the three PNAs were used together. This resulted in a dramatic effect on the number and viability of NB4 cells in culture after 48 h of treatment. This phenomenon was preceded by induction of apoptosis that could be observed 24 h after treatment. No sign of granulocytic differentiation was observed after treatment. These effects were also noted on other leukemic cell lines that express PML but not the fusion transcript.

The domain is essential for signaling and is also found in the adaptor proteins Mal (MyD88 adaptor-like) and MyD88, which function to couple activation of the receptor to downstream signaling components. Experimental structures of two Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domains reveal a alpha-beta-fold similar to that of the bacterial chemotaxis protein CheY, and other evidence suggests that the adaptors can make heterotypic interactions with both the receptors and themselves. Here we show that the purified TIR domains of Mal and MyD88 can form stable heterodimers and also that Mal homodimers and oligomers are dissociated in the presence of ATP. To identify structural features that may contribute to the formation of signaling complexes, we produced models of the TIR domains from human Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Mal, and MyD88. We found that although the overall fold is conserved the electrostatic surface potentials are quite distinct. Docking studies of the models suggest that Mal and MyD88 bind to different regions in TLRs 2 and 4, a finding consistent with a cooperative role of the two adaptors in signaling. Mal and MyD88 are predicted to interact at a third non-overlapping site, suggesting that the receptor and adaptors may form heterotetrameric complexes. The theoretical model of the interactions is supported by experimental data from glutathione S-transferase pull-downs and co-immunoprecipitations. Neither theoretical nor experimental data suggest a direct role for the conserved proline in the BB-loop in the association of TLR4, Mal, and MyD88.

Also Puralpha binds to a GC/GA-rich sequence within its own promoter and inhibits gene expression, that is, Puralpha is autoregulated.

In contrast, mSin3B recruitment to certain promoters did not require p107 or p130, suggesting that recruitment of this corepressor can occur via E2F-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Remarkably, loss of pRB had no effect on HDAC1 or mSin3B recruitment. p107/p130 deficiency triggered a dramatic loss of E2F4 nuclear localization as well as transcriptional derepression, which is suggested by nucleosome mapping studies to be the result of localized hyperacetylation of nucleosomes proximal to E2F-binding sites. Taken together, these findings show that p130 escorts E2F4 into the nucleus and, together with corepressor complexes that contain mSin3B and/or HDAC1, directly represses transcription from target genes as cells withdraw from the cell cycle."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Insulin", "id": "-258248459161834405", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "6465619244786723349", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Akt", "id": "1975058959552154129", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PKB", "id": "5060867083387212480", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PRAS40", "id": "6655193057940320394", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Insulin", "id": "-4435640027439637257", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein kinase B", "id": "-4295226669683221197", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PKB", "id": "-8001811824983816989", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "-3664492710569888100", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Akt", "id": "-6498445621746017413", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TSC2", "id": "5146227337318057161", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Akt", "id": "7408829315394896720", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event proline-rich Akt/PKB substrate 40 kDa", "id": "-6382812838383575809", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Akt", "id": "8234579459792869317", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "-8934527218179919882", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "-1853902723362995229", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IRS-1", "id": "2716145582624388304", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Akt", "id": "-7866480059926256372", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Akt", "id": "-7603997675051441649", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event insulin", "id": "-8483058368991509976", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PRAS40", "id": "-8104928922396028374", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event insulin", "id": "-5052077287620018474", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Akt", "id": "6079953229927443506", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "-4228519996567216146", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event insulin", "id": "-4032589940162710269", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Akt", "id": "2897255207131554660", "answers": [{"text": 948, "answer_start": "inactivates"}, {"text": 126, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event mammalian target of rapamycin", "id": "28792122624241570", "answers": [{"text": 126, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "1945880089464201093", "answers": [{"text": 269, "answer_start": "activates"}, {"text": 568, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1024, "answer_start": "response"}, {"text": 889, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 663, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 626, "answer_start": "binds"}, {"text": 820, "answer_start": "Binding"}, {"text": 455, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 838, "answer_start": "inhibits"}, {"text": 1184, "answer_start": "stimulate"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event tuberous sclerosis complex 2", "id": "2114563360007911534", "answers": [{"text": 307, "answer_start": "inhibition"}, {"text": 287, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TSC2", "id": "-7671630686530885593", "answers": [{"text": 917, "answer_start": "lacking"}, {"text": 422, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PRAS40", "id": "-1359252740668965406", "answers": [{"text": 1077, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1104, "answer_start": "association"}, {"text": 568, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 663, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 626, "answer_start": "binds"}, {"text": 820, "answer_start": "Binding"}, {"text": 938, "answer_start": "silencing"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event insulin-receptor substrate-1", "id": "-3028622583499043933", "answers": [{"text": 948, "answer_start": "inactivates"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event 14-3-3", "id": "-7759833368349077707", "answers": [{"text": 1104, "answer_start": "association"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Insulin signalling to mTOR mediated by the Akt/PKB substrate PRAS40. \nInsulin stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth by activation of the protein kinases Akt (also known as protein kinase B, PKB) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). It was reported that Akt activates mTOR by phosphorylation and inhibition of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2). However, in recent studies the physiological requirement of Akt phosphorylation of TSC2 for mTOR activation has been questioned. Here, we identify PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt/PKB substrate 40 kDa) as a novel mTOR binding partner that mediates Akt signals to mTOR. PRAS40 binds the mTOR kinase domain and its interaction with mTOR is induced under conditions that inhibit mTOR signalling, such as nutrient or serum deprivation or mitochondrial metabolic inhibition. Binding of PRAS40 inhibits mTOR activity and suppresses constitutive activation of mTOR in cells lacking TSC2. PRAS40 silencing inactivates insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Akt, and uncouples the response of mTOR to Akt signals. Furthermore, PRAS40 phosphorylation by Akt and association with 14-3-3, a cytosolic anchor protein, are crucial for insulin to stimulate mTOR. These findings identify PRAS40 as an important regulator of insulin sensitivity of the Akt-mTOR pathway and a potential target for the treatment of cancers, insulin resistance and hamartoma syndromes."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event AML1", "id": "5207989120314393472", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event RUNX1", "id": "8054368768437090774", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "716236664766541705", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event RUNX1", "id": "2120125130155407380", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "-8445721494210773144", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "-163601861993317800", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "1812902771667524794", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "-2263635856457329881", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "-6510593640254770158", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "2652009926917996441", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "3799482229635368620", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "1262635819416949135", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AML1", "id": "4707673286393590242", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "AML1/RUNX1 functions as a cytoplasmic attenuator of NF-kappaB signaling in the repression of myeloid tumors. \nFunctional deregulation of transcription factors has been found in many types of tumors.

However, the molecular basis and therapeutic targets of AML1-related leukemia are still elusive. Here, we explored immediate target pathways of AML1 by in vitro synchronous inactivation in hematopoietic cells. We found that AML1 inhibits NF-kappaB signaling through interaction with IkappaB kinase complex in the cytoplasm. Remarkably, AML1 mutants found in myeloid tumors lack the ability to inhibit NF-kappaB signaling, and human cases with AML1-related leukemia exhibits distinctly activated NF-kappaB signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling in leukemic cells with mutated AML1 efficiently blocks their growth and development of leukemia. These findings reveal a novel role for AML1 as a cytoplasmic attenuator of NF-kappaB signaling and indicate that NF-kappaB signaling is one of the promising therapeutic targets of hematologic malignancies with AML1 abnormality."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Kremen", "id": "8209766805373806925", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-2536986752820680437", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Kremen", "id": "2304708646299760087", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Krm", "id": "2623730159486817222", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Krm1", "id": "-1964188334325869060", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Krm", "id": "4133050584170163321", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Krm2", "id": "1599598930346431600", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Dickkopf", "id": "-4606367382943261307", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Dkk", "id": "5868747306726144597", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-6266497748734257401", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "-1601648053146050606", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Dkk", "id": "2360240419923684671", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Lrp5/6", "id": "9152644254123397835", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "3439038628617920815", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "250715838051211190", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "8293672794330832876", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-2018400123112612501", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "-1101221841456685265", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "4347651326635632711", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Dkk", "id": "-9217686290326089889", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Krm", "id": "2532512849472800102", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "1381727522685695011", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "-7609593009807484335", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "4370720722369760699", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "960402129465066833", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Dkk", "id": "-153934545134111562", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Krm", "id": "-4565268676850178762", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-2173618806277145736", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "3401569350619990690", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Krm", "id": "-1297312474052036892", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "9089715362289577713", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "-1001903231309719882", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Krm", "id": "3334076557072144191", "answers": [{"text": 405, "answer_start": "formation of a ternary complex"}, {"text": 1475, "answer_start": "deficit"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Krm1", "id": "2502132446464326029", "answers": [{"text": 670, "answer_start": "Inhibition"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event 2", "id": "2037477641846681094", "answers": [{"text": 670, "answer_start": "Inhibition"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Krms", "id": "3411841549821599352", "answers": [{"text": 746, "answer_start": "localization"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Dkks", "id": "8183912814541571276", "answers": [{"text": 746, "answer_start": "localization"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event krm1", "id": "-5666341547942639923", "answers": [{"text": 1081, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 915, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 1124, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The functions and possible significance of Kremen as the gatekeeper of Wnt signalling in development and pathology. \nKremen (Krm) was originally discovered as a novel transmembrane protein containing the kringle domain. Both Krm1 (the first identified Krm) and its relative Krm2 were later identified to be the high-affinity receptors for Dickkopf (Dkk), the inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. The formation of a ternary complex composed of Krm, Dkk, and Lrp5/6 (the coreceptor of Wnt) inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. In Xenopus gastrula embryos, Wnt/beta-catenin signalling regulates anterior-posterior patterning, with low-signalling in anterior regions. Inhibition of Krm1/2 induces embryonic head defects. Together with anterior localization of Krms and Dkks, the inhibition of Wnt signalling by Dkk-Krm action seems to allow anterior embryonic development. During mammalian development, krm1 mRNA expression is low in the early stages, but gradually and continuously increases with developmental progression and differentiation. In contrast with the wide, strong expression of krm1 mRNA in mature tissues, expression of krm1 is diminished in a variety of human tumor cells. Since stem cells and undifferentiated cells rely on Wnt/beta-catenin signalling for maintenance in a low differentiation state, the physiological shutdown of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by Dkk-Krm is likely to set cells on a divergent path toward differentiation. In tumour cells, a deficit of Krm may increase the susceptibility to tumourigenic transformation. Both positive and negative regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling definitively contributes to diverse developmental and physiological processes, including cell-fate determination, tissue patterning and stem cell regulation. Krm is quite significant in these processes as the gatekeeper of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event eIF4E", "id": "301471508571122407", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event eIF4E-binding protein 1", "id": "-6219236970856561835", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event eIF4E-binding protein 1", "id": "1078328665802693346", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event eukaryotic initiation factor 4E", "id": "1992864928033680969", "answers": [{"text": 72, "answer_start": "affinity"}, {"text": 0, "answer_start": "Phosphorylation"}, {"text": 165, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event eIF4E", "id": "6258004643010404162", "answers": [{"text": 1095, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}, {"text": 738, "answer_start": "affinity"}, {"text": 921, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 471, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1084, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 692, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1237, "answer_start": "nonphopshorylated"}, {"text": 1178, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E markedly reduces its affinity for capped mRNA. \nIn eukaryotes, a key step in the initiation of translation is the binding of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) to the cap structure of the mRNA.

Mitogens and cytokines stimulate the phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser(209), but the functional consequences of this modification have remained a major unresolved question. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance techniques, we show that phosphorylation of eIF4E markedly reduces its affinity for capped RNA, primarily due to an increased rate of dissociation. Variant eIF4E proteins harboring negatively charged acidic residues at position 209 also showed decreased binding to capped RNA. Furthermore, a basic residue at position 159 was shown to be essential for cap binding. Although eIF4E-binding protein 1 greatly stabilized binding of phosphorylated eIF4E to capped RNA, in the presence of eIF4E-binding protein 1 the phosphorylated form still dissociated faster compared with nonphopshorylated eIF4E.

factors, insulin, oxidative stress, and cytokines activate ERK1/2 by PKCdelta and MEK1/2. Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR), a Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase and intracellular scaffold/bridge/anchor, is a nuclear transporter of MEK1/2-stimulated ERK1/2 (Lerner-Marmarosh, N., Miralem, T., Gibbs, P. E., and Maines, M. D. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 6870-6875). hBVR, PKCdelta, and MEK1/2 overlap in their tissue expression profile and type of activators. Presently, we report on formation of an hBVR-PKCdelta-ERK2 ternary complex that is essential for ERK2 signal transduction and activation of genes linked to cell proliferation and cancer. MEK1/2 and the protein phosphatase PP2A were also present in the complex. When cells were stimulated with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), an increased interaction between hBVR and PKCdelta was detected by FRET-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. hBVR and ERK2 were phosphorylated by PKCdelta; however, the PKC was not a substrate for either ERK2 or hBVR. IGF-1 and phorbol ester increased hBVR/PKCdelta binding; hBVR was required for the activation of PKCdelta and its interaction with ERK2. The C-terminal phenylalanine residues of PKCdelta (Phe(660), Phe(663), and Phe(665)) were necessary for binding to ERK2 but not for hBVR binding. Formation of the hBVR-PKCdelta-ERK2 complex required the hBVR docking site for ERK, FXFP (DEF, C-box) and D(delta)-box (ILXXLXL) motifs. The hBVR-based peptide KKRILHCLGLA inhibited PKC activation and PKCdelta/ERK2 interaction. Phorbol ester- and TNF-alpha-dependent activation of the ERK-regulated transcription factors Elk1 and NF-kappaB and expression of the iNOS gene were suppressed by hBVR siRNA; those activities were rescued by hBVR. The findings reveal the direct input of hBVR in PKCdelta/ERK signaling and identify hBVR-based peptide regulators of ERK-mediated gene activation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1", "id": "-197279476829745058", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1", "id": "3320758184809109300", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 11beta-HSD1", "id": "5857947005736316101", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 11beta-HSD1", "id": "3397519423658293398", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HSD11B1", "id": "2680783799872609662", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase", "id": "1444429026202140588", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 11beta-HSD1", "id": "-2132986056174444132", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase", "id": "7266680701941629749", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event glucocorticoid receptor", "id": "-7922655241711610993", "answers": [{"text": 377, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event cortisone reductase", "id": "-1459872302307170265", "answers": [{"text": 611, "answer_start": "deficiency"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event 11beta-HSD1", "id": "3019982727853332097", "answers": [{"text": 649, "answer_start": "knockout"}, {"text": 1198, "answer_start": "inhibition"}, {"text": 1119, "answer_start": "crucial"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1: a tissue-specific regulator of glucocorticoid response. \n11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) interconverts inactive cortisone and active cortisol.

In this review, we discuss both the genetic and enzymatic characterization of 11beta-HSD1, as well as describing its role in physiology and pathology in a tissue-specific manner. The molecular basis of cortisone reductase deficiency, the putative \"11beta-HSD1 knockout state\" in humans, has been defined and is caused by intronic mutations in HSD11B1 that decrease gene transcription together with mutations in hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an endoluminal enzyme that provides reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate as cofactor to 11beta-HSD1 to permit reductase activity. We speculate that hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and therefore reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate supply may be crucial in determining the directionality of 11beta-HSD1 activity.

The protein contains seven Cys residues and consists of a heterogeneous collection of disulfide-linked oligomers. To investigate the role of sulfhydryls in MD-2 structure and function, we created 17 single and multiple Cys substitution mutants. All of the MD-2 mutant proteins, including one totally lacking Cys residues, were secreted and stable. SDSPAGE analyses indicated that most Cys residues could participate in oligomer formation and that no single Cys residue was required for oligomerization. Of the single Cys substitutions, only C95S and C105S failed to confer LPS responsiveness on TLR4 when mutant and TLR4 were cotransfected into cells expressing an NF-kappaB reporter plasmid. Surprisingly, substitution of both C95 and C105 partially restored activity. Structural analyses revealed that C95 and C105 formed an intrachain disulfide bond, whereas C95 by itself produced an inactive dimer. In contrast to the cotransfection experiments, only WT MD-2 conferred responsiveness to LPS when secreted proteins were added directly to TLR4 reporter cells. Our data are consistent with a model in which most, possibly all sulfhydryls lie on the surface of a stable MD-2 core structure where they form both intra- and interchain disulfide bridges.

However, the mechanisms underlying TGF-beta1 suppression of inflammation remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that TGF-beta1 inhibited TNF-alpha- or IL-1-induced RANTES expression in human kidney tubular epithelial cells (HKC-8). To delineate the mechanism by which TGF-beta1 inhibits RANTES expression, we examined the potential signal pathway activated by TGF-beta1 in suppressing NF-kappaB signaling. TGF-beta1 affected neither TNF-alpha-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, nor p65 NF-kappaB phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation. However, TGF-beta1 could inhibit p65 and p50 binding to the kappaB site in human RANTES promoter as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and protein-DNA binding assay. We found that TGF-beta1 induced glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylation on Ser-9 in HKC-8 cells, leading to its inactivation. Knockdown of GSK-3beta mimicked TGF-beta1 and inhibited RANTES induction, whereas overexpression of GSK-3beta abolished the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 and completely restored RANTES expression. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 induced the dephosphorylation and activation of beta-catenin, a major downstream target of GSK-3beta. Ectopic expression of constitutively active beta-catenin mimicked the TGF-beta1 effect and completely suppressed RANTES expression induced by TNF-alpha. Interestingly, TGF-beta1 induced a physical interaction between beta-catenin and p65 NF-kappaB, which prevented p65 binding to the kappaB site, sequestered its trans-activating activity, and repressed p65-mediated gene transcription. We conclude that TGF-beta1 inhibition of proinflammatory RANTES expression is mediated by beta-catenin-triggered blockade of NF-kappaB signaling."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event PPARgamma", "id": "7248157392271508336", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1", "id": "1843876186410863307", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNIP1", "id": "-5932150868277770719", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PPAR", "id": "6252803212114482704", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNIP1", "id": "6547466995251472354", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNIP1", "id": "-3055199335385127086", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNIP1", "id": "-4199390757899475630", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNIP1", "id": "6271511895064186678", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNIP1", "id": "822836895813276988", "answers": [{"text": 76, "answer_start": "repressor"}, {"text": 618, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 1648, "answer_start": "control"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Nef", "id": "6583623882619965482", "answers": [{"text": 210, "answer_start": "interaction"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TNFalpha", "id": "-3707012702268623082", "answers": [{"text": 258, "answer_start": "reduction"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event retinoic acid receptors", "id": "9158743533161016625", "answers": [{"text": 359, "answer_start": "corepression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors", "id": "7093838254623767502", "answers": [{"text": 359, "answer_start": "corepression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PPAR", "id": "6778253292371463074", "answers": [{"text": 1767, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 1356, "answer_start": "regulation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "PPARgamma and NF-kappaB regulate the gene promoter activity of their shared repressor, TNIP1. \nHuman TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) has diverse functions including support of HIV replication through its interaction with viral Nef and matrix proteins, reduction of TNFalpha-induced signaling through its interaction with NF-kappaB pathway proteins, and corepression of agonist-bound retinoic acid receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR). The wide tissue distribution of TNIP1 provides the opportunity to influence numerous cellular responses in these roles and defining control of TNIP1 expression would be central to improved understanding of its impact on cell function. We cloned 6kb of the human TNIP1 promoter and performed predictive and functional analyses to identify regulatory elements. The promoter region proximal to the transcription start site is GC-rich without a recognizable TATA box. In contrast to this proximal ~500bp region, 6kb of the promoter increased reporter construct constitutive activity over five-fold. Throughout the 6kb length, in silico analysis identified several potential binding sites for both constitutive and inducible transcription factors; among the latter were candidate NF-kappaB binding sequences and peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs). We tested NF-kappaB and PPAR regulation of the endogenous TNIP1 gene and cloned promoter by expression studies, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 62 ampullary adenocarcinoma patients who underwent curative surgery between 1996 and 2005 were included. Expression analysis of PML was carried out by immunohistochemical staining and correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In 24 tumor specimens (38.7%), PML was classified as absent, in 16 (25.8%) as focally expressed and in 22 (35.5%) as diffusely expressed. By univariate analysis, DFS was significantly influenced by pathological T stage (P=0.03), lymph nodal involvement (P=0.002), and PML expression (P=0.001). DFS in patients without PML expression was 28.0 months versus 45.1 and 75.5 for patients with focal and diffuse expression, respectively. OS in the group of patients without PML expression, with focal expression, and with diffuse expression was 40, 48, and 77 months, respectively (P=0.002). By a multivariate analysis, PML expression was the strongest prognostic factor for DFS (P=0.003) and the only statically significant prognostic factor for OS (P=0.009).

Among the most well-characterized transcriptional targets of p53 is the mdm2 oncogene. Activation of mdm2 is critical in the p53 pathway because the mdm2 protein marks p53 for proteosome-mediated degradation, thereby providing a negative-feedback loop. Here we show that the ATM-related TRRAP protein functionally cooperates with p53 to activate mdm2 transcription. TRRAP is a component of several multiprotein acetyltransferase complexes implicated in both transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. In support of a role for these complexes in mdm2 expression, we show that transactivation of the mdm2 gene is augmented by pharmacological inhibition of cellular deacetylases. In vitro analysis demonstrates that p53 directly binds to a TRRAP domain previously shown to be an activator docking site. Furthermore, transfection of cells with antisense TRRAP blocks p53-dependent transcription of mdm2. Finally, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate direct p53-dependent recruitment of TRRAP to the mdm2 promoter, followed by increased histone acetylation. These findings suggest a model in which p53 directly recruits a TRRAP/acetyltransferase complex to the mdm2 gene to activate transcription.

Despite our understanding of the structural changes, which occur upon Cdk/cyclin formation and activation, little is known about the dynamics of the molecular events involved. We have characterized the mechanism of Cdk2/cyclin A complex formation and activation at the molecular and dynamic level by rapid kinetics and demonstrate here that it is a two-step process. The first step involves the rapid association between the PSTAIRE helix of Cdk2 and helices 3 and 5 of the cyclin to yield an intermediate complex in which the threonine in the T-loop is not accessible for phosphorylation. Additional contacts between the C-lobe of the Cdk and the N-terminal helix of the cyclin then induce the isomerization of the Cdk into a fully mature form by promoting the exposure of the T-loop for phosphorylation by CAK and the formation of the substrate binding site.

Its activation during anaphase is characterized by dissociation from its inhibitor Cfi1/Net1 in the nucleolus and is controlled by two regulatory networks. The Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) network promotes activation of the phosphatase during early anaphase, whereas the mitotic exit network (MEN) activates Cdc14 during late stages of anaphase. RESULTS: Here we investigate how the FEAR network component Spo12 regulates Cdc14 activation. We identify the replication fork block protein Fob1 as a Spo12-interacting factor. Inactivation of FOB1 leads to premature release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in metaphase-arrested cells. Conversely, high levels of FOB1 delay the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus. Fob1 associates with Cfi1/Net1, and consistent with this observation, we find that the bulk of Cdc14 localizes to the Fob1 binding region within the rDNA repeats. Finally, we show that Spo12 phosphorylation is cell cycle regulated and affects its binding to Fob1. CONCLUSIONS: Fob1 functions as a negative regulator of the FEAR network.

Although poorly membrane permeable, prostaglandins are believed to exit cells by passive diffusion. We have investigated the interaction between prostaglandins and members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCC [multidrug resistance protein (MRP)] family of membrane export pumps. In inside-out membrane vesicles derived from insect cells or HEK293 cells, MRP4 catalyzed the time- and ATP-dependent uptake of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and PGE2. In contrast, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP5 did not transport PGE1 or PGE2. The MRP4-mediated transport of PGE1 and PGE2 displayed saturation kinetics, with Km values of 2.1 and 3.4 microM, respectively. Further studies showed that PGF1alpha, PGF2alpha, PGA1, and thromboxane B2 were high-affinity inhibitors (and therefore presumably substrates) of MRP4. Furthermore, several nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were potent inhibitors of MRP4 at concentrations that did not inhibit MRP1. In cells expressing the prostaglandin transporter PGT, the steady-state accumulation of PGE1 and PGE2 was reduced proportional to MRP4 expression. Inhibition of MRP4 by an MRP4-specific RNA interference construct or by indomethacin reversed this accumulation deficit. Together, these data suggest that MRP4 can release prostaglandins from cells, and that, in addition to inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs might also act by inhibiting this release."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Ran", "id": "2996116273119464411", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ran", "id": "1572820422590374857", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ran", "id": "2334757395068837080", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ran", "id": "4609393624544400671", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ran", "id": "-624871912799934067", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mad2", "id": "-7615172014137524045", "answers": [{"text": 26, "answer_start": "localization"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Mad2p", "id": "-2908417539423977644", "answers": [{"text": 848, "answer_start": "localization"}, {"text": 663, "answer_start": "displaced"}, {"text": 156, "answer_start": "localize"}, {"text": 1082, "answer_start": "localization"}, {"text": 711, "answer_start": "displacement"}, {"text": 924, "answer_start": "release"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Mad1p", "id": "1501828645987943731", "answers": [{"text": 663, "answer_start": "displaced"}, {"text": 156, "answer_start": "localize"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MAD1", "id": "8607208641753017686", "answers": [{"text": 218, "answer_start": "Deletion"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MAD2", "id": "5943186079815802769", "answers": [{"text": 218, "answer_start": "Deletion"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Ran", "id": "-6553566580098615621", "answers": [{"text": 418, "answer_start": "localization"}, {"text": 615, "answer_start": "disrupt"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Ran GTPase regulates Mad2 localization to the nuclear pore complex. \nIn yeast and mammalian cells, the spindle assembly checkpoint proteins Mad1p and Mad2p localize to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) during interphase.

Among these properties is the ability to regulate activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. In many human cancers, p53 is inactivated by mutation or other means, in some cases as a result of up-regulation of the negative regulator MDM2. However, the majority of ALK-expressing ALCL carry wild-type p53 and do not over express MDM2. We demonstrate a novel p53-dependent pathogenetic mechanism in ALK-expressing lymphoma. We confirm previously published reports of NPM-ALK-induced activation of the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) stress-activated protein (SAP) kinase proteins, but in this study demonstrate a role for these in the regulation of p53 activity in an intricate signaling system. Specifically, constitutive ALK signaling leads to the functional inactivation and/or degradation of p53 in JNK and MDM2 dependent manners. We also show nuclear exclusion of p53 in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner.

It is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel Phlebovirus in family Bunyaviridae. Although the viral pathogenesis remains largely unknown, hemopoietic cells appear to be targeted by the virus. In this study we report that human monocytes were susceptible to SFTSV, which replicated efficiently, as shown by an immunofluorescence assay and real-time reverse transcription-PCR. We examined host responses in the infected cells and found that antiviral interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible proteins were induced upon infection. However, our data also indicated that downregulation of key molecules such as mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) or weakened activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and NF-kappaB responses may contribute to a restricted innate immunity against the infection. NSs, the nonstructural protein encoded by the S segment, suppressed the beta interferon (IFN-beta) and NF-kappaB promoter activities, although NF-kappaB activation appears to facilitate SFTSV replication in human monocytes. NSs was found to be associated with TBK1 and may inhibit the activation of downstream IRF and NF-kappaB signaling through this interaction. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the nucleoprotein (N), also encoded by the S segment, exhibited a suppressive effect on the activation of IFN-beta and NF-kappaB signaling as well. Infected monocytes, mainly intact and free of apoptosis, may likely be implicated in persistent viral infection, spreading the virus to the circulation and causing primary viremia.

D-type cyclins bind to and activate the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6, which in turn phosphorylate their downstream target, the retinoblastoma protein Rb. Upon Rb phosphorylation, the E2F transcription factors activate the expression of S-phase genes and thereby induce cell cycle progression. The raise of cyclin D levels in early G1 also serves to titrate Kip/Cip proteins away from cyclinE/Cdk2 complexes, further accelerating cell cycle progression. Therefore, cyclin D plays essential roles in the response to mitogens, transmitting their signal to the Rb/E2F pathway. Surprisingly, cyclin D1-deficient animals are viable and have developmental abnormalities limited to restricted tissues, such as retina, the nervous system and breast epithelium. This observation, combined with several other studies, have raised the possibility that cyclin D1 may have new activities that are unrelated to its function as a cdk regulatory subunit and as regulator of Rb. Effectively, cyclin D has been reported to have transcriptional functions since it interacts with several transcription factors to regulate their activity. Most often, this effect does not rely on the kinase function of Cdk4, indicating that this function is probably independent of cell cycle progression. Further extending its role in gene regulation, cyclin D interacts with histone acetylases such as P/CAF or NcoA/SRC1a but also with components of the transcriptional machinery such as TAF(II)250. Therefore, these studies suggest that the functions of cyclin D might need to be reevaluated. They have established a new cdk-independent role of cyclin D1 as a transcriptional regulator, indicating that cyclin D1 can act via two different mechanisms, as a cdk activator it regulates cell cycle progression and as a transcriptional regulator, it modulates the activity of transcription factors."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event p300", "id": "-553049369978127842", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p65", "id": "-732479960473638426", "answers": [{"text": 1197, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 102, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1303, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 1087, "answer_start": "translocation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TNFalpha", "id": "4041438650176210181", "answers": [{"text": 552, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 772, "answer_start": "decreased"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MCP-1", "id": "3232022306529437736", "answers": [{"text": 772, "answer_start": "decreased"}, {"text": 573, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event IkappaBalpha", "id": "5984157340423678741", "answers": [{"text": 1042, "answer_start": "degradation"}, {"text": 1022, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Licochalcone A significantly suppresses LPS signaling pathway through the inhibition of NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation at serine 276. \nLicorice root, Glycyrrhiza inflata, has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of bronchial asthma and inflammation; however, the mechanism of its anti-inflammatory activity has not been clarified.

We found that Licochalcone A remarkably inhibited LPS-induced NO production, and TNFalpha expression and MCP-1 expression in both RAW264.7 cells and primary macrophages. Furthermore, when injected with Licochalcone A prior to injection of LPS, the serum level of TNFalpha and MCP-1 in C57BL/6 mice was clearly decreased, indicating that Licochalcone A has a potent anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, Licochalcone A significantly inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activation; however, it had no effect on not only the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha but also nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB p65. Interestingly, Licochalcone A markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of p65 at serine 276. As a result, it reduced NF-kappaB transactivation by preventing the interaction of p65 with p300.

The activation of NF-kappaB is tightly controlled and the deubiquitinase CYLD has emerged as a key negative regulator of NF-kappaB signalling. Optineurin, mutated in certain glaucomas and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is also a negative regulator of NF-kappaB activation. It competes with NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator) for binding to ubiquitinated RIP (receptor interacting protein) to prevent NF-kappaB activation. Recently we identified CYLD as optineurin-interacting protein. Here we have analysed the functional significance of interaction of optineurin with CYLD. Our results show that a glaucoma-associated mutant of optineurin, H486R, is altered in its interaction with CYLD. Unlike wild-type optineurin, the H486R mutant did not inhibit tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced NF-kappaB activation. CYLD mediated inhibition of TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation was abrogated by expression of the H486R mutant. Upon knockdown of optineurin, CYLD was unable to inhibit TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and showed drastically reduced interaction with ubiquitinated RIP. The level of ubiquitinated RIP was increased in optineurin knockdown cells. Deubiquitination of RIP by over-expressed CYLD was abrogated in optineurin knockdown cells. These results suggest that optineurin regulates NF-kappaB activation by mediating interaction of CYLD with ubiquitinated RIP thus facilitating deubiquitination of RIP."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event p53", "id": "-1465302975153219232", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "7954821492361534906", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAIL", "id": "2709619434947156219", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event interferon-gamma", "id": "4327202946140917956", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "-1628101008392735496", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event proapoptotic", "id": "3434711343253114344", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAIL", "id": "8258499232237736842", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "-8202312058051490752", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-5926363022811705150", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "-2524601344718172782", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "7516488309063465995", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "4843900870956719910", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-2675814862982026350", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-Lapachone", "id": "8694103749568913452", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "4156222514355173878", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-4279091223531983659", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-5024537344646286006", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "-8200917369997091096", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-7776495645070924540", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "-4416257148419346730", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-5518711669040671844", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event actinomycin D", "id": "-5511030581078087925", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "1434340460858889391", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event interferon-gamma", "id": "-4230978293297386039", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IFN-gamma", "id": "5554379125953712828", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "583636854122209517", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-8714423053366340445", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "-3558497829000501343", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IFN-gamma", "id": "-2755653347990528267", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event STAT1", "id": "8747716777742543497", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IFN-gamma", "id": "-2448581956001634707", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "-1638490000184629752", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "2599249950403948676", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event STAT1", "id": "-8081097510041171634", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event KILLER", "id": "-5994554777243042196", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DR5", "id": "3905105715263858143", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-9215414887580831628", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-7041523118535995651", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event KILLER", "id": "6119427469202957479", "answers": [{"text": 542, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 1555, "answer_start": "induction"}, {"text": 58, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 958, "answer_start": "elevated"}, {"text": 379, "answer_start": "mRNA expression"}, {"text": 247, "answer_start": "induction"}, {"text": 805, "answer_start": "induced"}, {"text": 178, "answer_start": "binds"}, {"text": 1091, "answer_start": "induction"}, {"text": 1245, "answer_start": "increase"}, {"text": 1322, "answer_start": "induced"}, {"text": 1394, "answer_start": "induction"}, {"text": 644, "answer_start": "increased"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "p53-independent upregulation of KILLER/DR5 TRAIL receptor expression by glucocorticoids and interferon-gamma. \nKILLER/DR5 is a death-domain-containing proapoptotic receptor that binds to the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL.

We further extend those findings by classifying the capability of various apoptosis-inducing drugs to increase the expression of KILLER/DR5 mRNA in a p53-independent manner. beta-Lapachone, a topoisomerase inhibitor, increased KILLER/DR5 mRNA in colon cancer cell lines with wild-type p53 but not with mutant p53. In contrast, betulinic acid, a novel chemotherapeutic compound, induced apoptosis and KILLER/DR5 mRNA in melanoma and glioblastoma cells through a p53-independent mechanism. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone elevated KILLER/DR5 mRNA in glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, and colon cancer cell lines with mutant p53 undergoing apoptosis, and this induction was inhibited by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Although another glucocorticoid, prednisolone, also induced apoptosis, it did not increase KILLER/DR5 mRNA. Finally, the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced apoptosis and KILLER/DR5 in cell lines with mutant p53, and the induction of KILLER/DR5 mRNA by IFN-gamma was delayed in cells lacking wild-type STAT1, a transcription factor implicated in IFN-gamma signaling.

In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the BTK protein is essential for B cell survival, cell cycle progression, and proliferation in response to B cell antigen receptor (BCR) stimulation. BCR stimulation leads to the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, which in turn regulates genes controlling B cell growth. We now demonstrate that a null mutation in btk known to cause the xid phenotype prevents BCR-induced activation of NF-kappaB. This defect can be rescued by reconstitution with wild-type BTK. This mutation also interferes with BCR-directed activation of IkappaB kinase (IKK), which normally targets the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha for degradation.

In endothelial cells (EC), the transcription factor NF-kappaB is important in the switch from quiescence to activation, and is tightly controlled to avoid excessive inflammation and organ damage. Here we describe a novel mechanism that controls the activation of NF-kappaB in EC. The transcription factor Erg, the most highly expressed ETS member in resting EC, controls quiescence by repressing proinflammatory gene expression. Focusing on intercellular adhesion molecule 1(ICAM)-1 as a model, we identify two ETS binding sites (EBS -118 and -181) within the ICAM-1 promoter required for Erg-mediated repression. We show that Erg binds to both EBS -118 and EBS -181, the latter located within the NF-kappaB binding site. Interestingly, inhibition of Erg expression in quiescent EC results in increased NF-kappaB-dependent ICAM-1 expression, indicating that Erg represses basal NF-kappaB activity. Erg prevents NF-kappaB p65 from binding to the ICAM-1 promoter, suggesting a direct mechanism of interference. Gene set enrichment analysis of transcriptome profiles of Erg and NF-kappaB-dependent genes, together with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies, reveals that this mechanism is common to other proinflammatory genes, including cIAP-2 and IL-8.

Utilizing a novel combination of two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies, we also establish the order of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in vivo; phosphorylation of Thr 37/Thr 46 is followed by Thr 70 phosphorylation, and Ser 65 is phosphorylated last.

Although some of the transcriptional processes regulating its expression have been established, the diversity of genes that may be controlling the levels of its expression in both normal cells as well as in cancer cells has not been fully explored. The most common genetically mutated pathways in human malignancies are the p53 tumor suppressor pathway and the RB/E2F pathway. Both of these pathways, when intact, provide essential checkpoints in the maintenance of normal cell growth and protect the cell from DNA damage. Using non-transformed embryonic fibroblasts, we provide evidence of a molecular link between the regulation of survivin transcription and the RB/E2F family of proteins. We demonstrate that both pRB and p130 can interact with the survivin promoter and can repress survivin transcription.

Genetically modified cells that harbor deletions in various members of the RB/E2F family confirm our data from the wild-type cells.

We investigated whether signal-specific activation of mating and invasive growth involves regulation of the transcription factor Tec1 by Fus3 and Kss1. We present evidence that, during mating, Fus3 phosphorylates Tec1 to downregulate this invasive growth-specific transcription factor and its target genes. This function of Fus3 is essential for correct execution of the mating program and is not shared by Kss1.

Chlamydial heat shock protein 60 (cHSP60) has been implicated in the induction of deleterious immune responses in human chlamydial infections and has been found to colocalize with infiltrating macrophages in atheroma lesions. cHSP60 might stimulate, enhance, and maintain innate immune and inflammatory responses and contribute to atherogenesis. In this study, we investigated the signaling mechanism of cHSP60. Recombinant cHSP60 rapidly activated NF-kappaB in human microvascular endothelial cells (EC) and in mouse macrophages, and induced human IL-8 promoter activity in EC. The inflammatory effect of cHSP60 was heat labile, thus excluding a role of contaminating LPS, and was blocked by specific anti-chlamydial HSP60 mAb. In human vascular EC which express Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA and protein, nonsignaling TLR4 constructs that act as dominant negative blocked cHSP60-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, an anti-TLR4 Ab abolished cHSP60-induced cellular activation, whereas a control Ab had no effect. In 293 cells, cHSP60-mediated NF-kappaB activation required both TLR4 and MD2. A dominant-negative MyD88 construct also inhibited cHSP60-induced NF-kappaB activation. Collectively, our results indicate that cHSP60 is a potent inducer of vascular EC and macrophage inflammatory responses, which are very relevant to atherogenesis. The inflammatory effects are mediated through the innate immune receptor complex TLR4-MD2 and proceeds via the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. These findings may help elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic asymptomatic chlamydial infection contribute to atherogenesis."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Mnd2", "id": "5837897007458574081", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ubiquitin", "id": "3321620011325385712", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MND2", "id": "-4187729441932389874", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Clb5", "id": "-869315539663401362", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mnd2", "id": "-3895360738955364846", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Clb5", "id": "-637068027687587286", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mnd2", "id": "-4321375298691874513", "answers": [{"text": 1155, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1571, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 613, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 491, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}, {"text": 8, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 680, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1289, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Mitotic phosphorylation of the anaphase-promoting complex inhibitory subunit Mnd2 is necessary for efficient progression through meiosis i. \nThe yeast anaphase-promoting complex (APC) subunit Mnd2 is necessary for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion in prophase I of meiosis by inhibiting premature ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of substrates by the APC(Ama1) ubiquitin ligase.

Several isoforms of p53 have been discovered, some of which inhibit p53 function. We therefore examined whether p53 isoforms were present in melanoma and whether they may contribute to aberrant p53 function in melanoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied the expression and subcellular localization of p53 and its isoforms in a panel of human melanoma cell lines using Western blot, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and reverse transcription-PCR. We also characterized the relationship between the expression of p53, p53 isoforms, and p53 target genes following treatment with the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin. RESULTS: We report that p53beta and Delta40p53 were expressed in the majority of melanoma cell lines at the mRNA level, but were absent or expressed at low levels in fibroblasts and melanocytes, suggesting that their expression may play a role in melanoma development. Analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that p53beta was expressed at the protein level in melanoma cells. Both p53 and the small molecular weight forms of p53 were aberrantly expressed between the nuclear and cytosolic fractions of melanoma cell lines, compared with normal fibroblasts. Treatment with cisplatin had differential effects on WTp53 and the small molecular weight form of p53 that were cell line dependent. Delta40p53 was shown to inhibit, whereas p53beta was shown to enhance, p53-dependent transcription of p21 and PUMA.

Previous reports suggested that NRF interferes with the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB binding sites through a direct interaction with NF-kappaB subunits. The aim of this study was to map specific NRF binding domains in the NF-kappaB proteins, p65 and p50. Our data demonstrate that NRF is able to interact with the p65 subunit and inhibit its transcription enhancing activity in reporter gene experiments. Using tandem affinity purifications (TAP), we show that NRF protein significantly binds to the endogenous p65, subunit but not to the p50 subunit. The selective binding activity of the NRF protein is consistently mediated by the N-terminal domain of NRF (Amino acids 1-380). Moreover, the Rel homology domain (RHD) of p65 is sufficient for binding to the N-terminal domain of NRF. Using detailed peptide mapping studies, we finally identify three peptide motifs in p65 RHD showing distinctive binding specificities for the NRF protein. According to the predicted structure of p65, all three peptide motifs align within an exposed region of p65 and might hint at promising targets for inhibitors."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Angiotensin II receptor", "id": "5835329014432165550", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Angiotensin II", "id": "-2165560364727059099", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ang II", "id": "-6529452624537395649", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event renin", "id": "-297268629091611838", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event angiotensin", "id": "3551067528124099307", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ang II", "id": "-7995940754811786042", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ang type1 receptors", "id": "-4727955738779693180", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AT(1)Rs", "id": "2921570569159539593", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ang II", "id": "3340585138792291964", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AT(1)R", "id": "-7036251822967739696", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NADPH oxidase", "id": "8842191732621805226", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NOS", "id": "1363280837180531719", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AT(1)R", "id": "-9031099789031207691", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ang II", "id": "-2465124638616637697", "answers": [{"text": 462, "answer_start": "effects"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event AT(1)Rs", "id": "7642424877194766823", "answers": [{"text": 540, "answer_start": "up-regulation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event AT(1)R", "id": "-5483986204540575033", "answers": [{"text": 1198, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 909, "answer_start": "up-regulation"}, {"text": 1002, "answer_start": "decreases"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event NO synthase", "id": "-1705230757340301216", "answers": [{"text": 1384, "answer_start": "interaction"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Regulation of Angiotensin II receptor signaling by cysteine modification of NF-kappaB. \nAngiotensin II (Ang II) is a major vasoactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin system. Ang II is originally found as one of potent vasoconstrictors, but is now attracted attention as an essential mediator of many cardiovascular problems, including endothelial dysfunction, arrhythmia and structural remodeling of cardiovascular systems. Most of the known pathophysiological effects of Ang II are mediated through Ang type1 receptors (AT(1)Rs), and the up-regulation of AT(1)Rs is one of important causes by which Ang II can contribute to cardiovascular diseases. A growing body of evidence has suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) play important roles in the regulation of AT(1)R signaling. In cardiac fibroblasts, stimulation with cytokines or bacterial toxins induces AT(1)R up-regulation through NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production. In contrast, nitric oxide (NO) decreases AT(1)R density through cysteine modification (S-nitrosylation) of a transcriptional factor, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). The difference between the effects of ROS and NO on AT(1)R expression may be caused by the difference between intracellular location of ROS signaling and that of NO signaling, as the agonist-induced S-nitrosylation of NF-kappaB requires a local interaction between NO synthase (NOS) and NF-kappaB in the perinuclear region. Thus, the spatial and temporal regulation of cysteine modification by ROS or RNS may underlie the resultant changes of AT(1)R signaling induced by agonist stimulation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event MAPKAP kinase-2", "id": "-8891670681741618129", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases", "id": "2705721897117190101", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event extracellular signal regulated kinases", "id": "-6136302154737475408", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Erks", "id": "2868352527253418913", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event stress-activated protein (SAP) kinases", "id": "3518817142708921444", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Erk", "id": "7249365000097954996", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP kinase", "id": "1395123399736346998", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP kinase", "id": "6184865213301295582", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SAP kinase p38", "id": "-7121687656350873057", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p38 SAP kinase", "id": "2921482774454085765", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP-kinase-activated protein kinase-2", "id": "5283984969515459442", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAPKAP kinase-2", "id": "820335288838320206", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p38", "id": "1556489138693794740", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAPKAP kinase-2", "id": "-6754516557463415952", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MKK3", "id": "-7023924912489531734", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MKK6", "id": "-6194606022290632472", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p38 SAP kinase", "id": "4084331179641479741", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAPKAP kinase-2", "id": "-1731029262624471415", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event stress-activated protein kinase", "id": "-456253134409290869", "answers": [{"text": 8, "answer_start": "export"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p38", "id": "9164185131220903679", "answers": [{"text": 1131, "answer_start": "complex"}, {"text": 1400, "answer_start": "activating"}, {"text": 1100, "answer_start": "exported"}, {"text": 8, "answer_start": "export"}, {"text": 1588, "answer_start": "localisation"}, {"text": 1617, "answer_start": "export"}, {"text": 1509, "answer_start": "effector"}, {"text": 1297, "answer_start": "activators"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MAP kinases", "id": "1494568099003876142", "answers": [{"text": 415, "answer_start": "moves"}, {"text": 335, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 442, "answer_start": "translocation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MAPKAP kinase-2", "id": "4548011983655266459", "answers": [{"text": 1196, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1002, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 1617, "answer_start": "export"}, {"text": 1161, "answer_start": "Export"}, {"text": 1048, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 937, "answer_start": "localisation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Nuclear export of the stress-activated protein kinase p38 mediated by its substrate MAPKAP kinase-2. \nBACKGROUND: Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (or extracellular signal regulated kinases; Erks) and stress-activated protein (SAP) kinases mediate cellular responses to a wide variety of signals. In the Erk MAP kinase pathway, activation of MAP kinases takes place in the cytoplasm and the activated enzyme moves to the nucleus. This translocation to the nucleus is essential to MAP kinase signalling because it enables the kinase to phosphorylate transcription factors. Whether components of the pathway mediated by the SAP kinase p38 change their cellular location on activation is not clear; we have therefore studied the cellular localisation of components of this pathway before and after stimulation. RESULTS: The p38 SAP kinase substrate MAP-kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP kinase-2) contains a putative nuclear localisation signal which we show is functional and required for activation by a variety of stimuli. Following phosphorylation of MAPKAP kinase-2, nuclear p38 was exported to the cytoplasm in a complex with MAPKAP kinase-2. Export of MAPKAP kinase-2 required phosphorylation by p38 but did not appear to require the kinase activity of MAPKAP kinase-2. The p38 activators MKK3 and MKK6 were present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, consistent with a role in activating p38 in the nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: In the p38 SAP kinase pathway, MAPKAP kinase-2 serves both as an effector of p38 by phosphorylating substrates and as a determinant of cellular localisation of p38. Nuclear export of p38 and MAPKAP kinase-2 may permit them to phosphorylate substrates in the cytoplasm."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event cyclooxygenase-2", "id": "3611220665113196751", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PGE2", "id": "8446806404839365094", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PGE4 receptors", "id": "5968486507315378076", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cyclooxygenase", "id": "8995801209987254199", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event COX", "id": "-3083070249142492327", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event COX-2", "id": "-9000768093871979469", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NO synthase", "id": "8435517303180978441", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKKdbeta", "id": "4878982203913763009", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein kinase C", "id": "-2931892966030490387", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p38 MAPK", "id": "1348846051538710388", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IL-6", "id": "-1425359635077029727", "answers": [{"text": 2059, "answer_start": "production"}, {"text": 240, "answer_start": "production"}, {"text": 466, "answer_start": "production"}, {"text": 27, "answer_start": "production"}, {"text": 1746, "answer_start": "production"}, {"text": 986, "answer_start": "production"}, {"text": 496, "answer_start": "production"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event IkappaB kinase alphabeta", "id": "-6692868332543675480", "answers": [{"text": 1074, "answer_start": "activations"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p65", "id": "-273587523803653061", "answers": [{"text": 1133, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1934, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event IKKdbeta kinase alphabeta", "id": "-2799132304160767328", "answers": [{"text": 1283, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event luciferase", "id": "-7238083780969190098", "answers": [{"text": 1535, "answer_start": "increase"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event COX-2", "id": "6509917752289782858", "answers": [{"text": 1772, "answer_start": "generated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event EP2", "id": "-1900234507537368806", "answers": [{"text": 1790, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event EP4 receptors", "id": "5126107076829092485", "answers": [{"text": 1790, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event protein kinase C", "id": "-2715657581218960703", "answers": [{"text": 1855, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event kinase alphabeta", "id": "-3060762178212250183", "answers": [{"text": 1855, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p38 MAPK", "id": "2819950244444541622", "answers": [{"text": 1855, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event IKKdbeta", "id": "6847289154867536507", "answers": [{"text": 1855, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Peptidoglycan-induced IL-6 production in RAW 264.7 macrophages is mediated by cyclooxygenase-2, PGE2/PGE4 receptors, protein kinase A, I kappa B kinase, and NF-kappa B. \nIn this study, we investigated the signaling pathway involved in IL-6 production caused by peptidoglycan (PGN), a cell wall component of the Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, in RAW 264.7 macrophages. PGN caused concentration- and time-dependent increases in IL-6, PGE(2), and cAMP production. PGN-mediated IL-6 production was inhibited by a nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor (indomethacin), a selective COX-2 inhibitor (NS398), a PGE(2) (EP2) antagonist (AH6809), a PGE(4) (EP4) antagonist (AH23848), and a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor (KT5720), but not by a nonselective NO synthase inhibitor (N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester). Furthermore, PGE(2), an EP2 agonist (butaprost), an EP2/PGE(3) (EP3)/EP4 agonist (misoprostol), and misoprostol in the presence of AH6809 all induced IL-6 production, whereas an EP1/EP3 agonist (sulprostone) did not. PGN caused time-dependent activations of IkappaB kinase alphabeta (IKKdbeta) and p65 phosphorylation at Ser(276), and these effects were inhibited by NS398 and KT5720. Both PGE(2) and 8-bromo-cAMP also caused IKKdbeta kinase alphabeta phosphorylation. PGN resulted in two waves of the formation of NF-kappaB-specific DNA-protein complexes. The first wave of NF-kappaB activation occurred at 10-60 min of treatment, whereas the later wave occurred at 2-12 h of treatment. The PGN-induced increase in kappaB luciferase activity was inhibited by NS398, AH6809, AH23848, KT5720, a protein kinase C inhibitor (Ro31-8220), and a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580). These results suggest that PGN-induced IL-6 production involves COX-2-generated PGE(2), activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors, cAMP formation, and the activation of PKA, protein kinase C, p38 MAPK, IKKdbeta, kinase alphabeta, p65 phosphorylation, and NF-kappaB.

Conversely, the recovery of low levels of p53 following UV exposure may depend on an increase in p90(MDM2). The level of p90(MDM2) is increased by UV light following the p53-dependent induction of an internal mdm2 promoter, P2. If this induction of mdm2 were critical for the recovery of low levels of p53 following UV exposure, defects in mdm2's transcription would result in a prolonged increase in p53. Cells defective in transcription coupled repair (TCR) maintain high levels of p53 for a prolonged period following UV exposure. Such cells also have defects in general transcription after UV irradiation. We investigated whether TCR-deficient cells express diminished levels of mdm2 mRNA and p90(MDM2) following UV exposure. We found that transcription of mdm2 was reduced in TCR-deficient cells. The uninducible mdm2 promoter, P1, was more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of UV irradiation than the P2 promoter. The decrease in transcription from the P1 promoter was sufficient to reduce the level of p90(MDM2) and correlated with a prolonged increase in p53. Thus, p53-independent transcription of mdm2 appears critical to p53's regulation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Protein kinase Cs", "id": "-6990328525984900550", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein kinase C", "id": "7005576842595914037", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein phosphatase 2A", "id": "-4917328599451775282", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein phosphatase 1", "id": "2405685545877515422", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein kinase C", "id": "8166186453929679638", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein kinase Cs", "id": "-8775740081568039726", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein kinase C", "id": "-767827487319675952", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Protein kinase C", "id": "-8532142151275349410", "answers": [{"text": 20, "answer_start": "regulated"}, {"text": 69, "answer_start": "phosphorylations"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event protein kinase C", "id": "-5194443850834294061", "answers": [{"text": 1185, "answer_start": "autophosphorylation"}, {"text": 1643, "answer_start": "autophosphorylation"}, {"text": 1118, "answer_start": "autophosphorylation"}, {"text": 1517, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1085, "answer_start": "autophosphorylates"}, {"text": 1745, "answer_start": "autophosphorylation"}, {"text": 1601, "answer_start": "autophosphorylate"}, {"text": 1235, "answer_start": "release"}, {"text": 287, "answer_start": "phosphorylations"}, {"text": 1305, "answer_start": "autophosphorylation"}, {"text": 1484, "answer_start": "phosphorylations"}, {"text": 1832, "answer_start": "localization"}, {"text": 1159, "answer_start": "autophosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event protein kinase C beta II", "id": "4578143894174139919", "answers": [{"text": 754, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}, {"text": 808, "answer_start": "dephosphorylated"}, {"text": 920, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 963, "answer_start": "dephosphorylated"}, {"text": 863, "answer_start": "yield"}, {"text": 1017, "answer_start": "inactive"}, {"text": 1008, "answer_start": "yield"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Protein kinase C is regulated in vivo by three functionally distinct phosphorylations. \nBACKGROUND: Protein kinase Cs are a family of enzymes that transduce the plethora of signals promoting lipid hydrolysis. Here, we show that protein kinase C must first be processed by three distinct phosphorylations before it is competent to respond to second messengers. RESULTS: We have identified the positions and functions of the in vivo phosphorylation sites of protein kinase C by mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing of native and phosphatase-treated kinase from the detergent-soluble fraction of cells. Specifically, the threonine at position 500 (T500) on the activation loop, and T641 and S660 on the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C beta II are phosphorylated in vivo. T500 and S660 are selectively dephosphorylated in vitro by protein phosphatase 2A to yield an enzyme that is still capable of lipid-dependent activation, whereas all three residues are dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 to yield an inactive enzyme. Biochemical analysis reveals that protein kinase C autophosphorylates on S660, that autophosphorylation on S660 follows T641 autophosphorylation, that autophosphorylation on S660 is accompanied by the release of protein kinase C into the cytosol, and that T500 is not an autophosphorylation site. CONCLUSIONS: Structural and biochemical analyses of native and phosphatase-treated protein kinase C indicate that protein kinase C is processed by three phosphorylations. Firstly, trans-phosphorylation on the activation loop (T500) renders it catalytically competent to autophosphorylate. Secondly, a subsequent autophosphorylation on the carboxyl terminus (T641) maintains catalytic competence. Thirdly, a second autophosphorylation on the carboxyl terminus (S660) regulates the enzyme's subcellular localization. The conservation of each of these residues (or an acidic residue) in conventional, novel and atypical protein kinase Cs underscores the essential role for each in regulating the protein kinase C family."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event IKKepsilon", "id": "-4736551791509932685", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TBK1", "id": "-370628809532017555", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IRF3", "id": "-5943645989689937399", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event interferon regulatory factor 3", "id": "-4810397327404795176", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IRF3", "id": "-6020969513820290046", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IkappaB kinase", "id": "6450812422268387188", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IkappaB kinase-epsilon", "id": "5330426598951774099", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKKepsilon", "id": "-1794881200359924095", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TANK-binding kinase-1", "id": "-3016669268387510739", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TBK1", "id": "5909520319152181649", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IRF3", "id": "8126883694769415698", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKKepsilon", "id": "6111092798572302093", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TBK1", "id": "-8362512564848651375", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll-like receptor 3", "id": "2991499016419168623", "answers": [{"text": 265, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event IRF3", "id": "401328990154264813", "answers": [{"text": 426, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 381, "answer_start": "Activation"}, {"text": 829, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 347, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "IKKepsilon and TBK1 are essential components of the IRF3 signaling pathway. \nThe transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-kappaB are required for the expression of many genes involved in the innate immune response.

How Gin4 kinase activity is regulated is not known. Here we showed that a neck-associated Ser/Thr kinase Elm1, which is important for septin assembly, is critical for proper modification of Gin4 and its physiological substrate Shs1. In vitro studies with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that Elm1 directly phosphorylates and activates Gin4, which in turn phosphorylates Shs1. Consistent with these observations, acute inhibition of Elm1 activity abolished mitotic Gin4 phosphorylation and Gin4-dependent Shs1 modification in vivo. In addition, a gin4 mutant lacking the Elm1-dependent phosphorylation sites exhibited an impaired localization to the bud-neck and, as a result, induced a significant growth defect with an elongated bud morphology. Thus, Elm1 regulates the septin assembly-dependent cellular events by directly phosphorylating and activating the Gin4-dependent pathway(s)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event mTOR", "id": "1807909352448910136", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event target of rapamycin", "id": "1387139988328041686", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TOR", "id": "-8466934445539962014", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TOR", "id": "-6852961780135201645", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "mTOR signaling to translation. \nOver the past few years, the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway has been implicated in the control of translation, both in yeast and in higher eukaryotes.

The LRP5 is a co-receptor of Wnt located on the osteoblast membrane between two other receptors, Frizzled and Kremen. Frizzled and LRP5 bind to Wnt, thereby stabilizing beta-catenin and activating bone formation. When the dickkopf protein (Dkk) binds to Kremen and LRP5, this last undergoes internalization and therefore becomes unable to bind Wnt; this leads to degradation of beta-catenin and to inhibition of bone formation. In humans, loss of LRP5 function causes osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, which is characterized by congenital blindness and extremely severe childhood-onset osteoporosis (lumbar spine Z-score often < -4) with fractures. The G171V mutation prevents Dkk from binding to LRP5, thereby increasing LRP5 function; the result is high bone mass due to uncoupling of bone formation and resorption. The Z-scores in this condition can exceed +6 at the hip and spine. The LRP5 and Wnt/beta-catenin reflect the level of bone formation and play a central role in bone mass accrual and normal distribution. Furthermore, LRP5 may contribute to mediate mechanical loads within bone tissue.

When activated, they convey signals to transcription factors that orchestrate the inflammatory response. However, the intracellular signaling events following TLR activation are largely unknown. Here we show that TLR2 stimulation by Staphylococcus aureus induces a fast and transient activation of the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and in 293 cells expressing TLR2. Dominant-negative Rac1N17, but not dominant-negative Cdc42N17, block nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) transactivation. S. aureus stimulation causes the recruitment of active Rac1 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) to the TLR2 cytosolic domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR2 is required for assembly of a multiprotein complex that is necessary for subsequent NF-kappa B transcriptional activity. A signaling cascade composed of Rac1, PI3K and Akt targets nuclear p65 transactivation independently of I kappa B alpha degradation. Thus Rac1 controls a second, I kappa B-independent, pathway to NF-kappa B activation and is essential in innate immune cell signaling via TLR2."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event forkhead", "id": "5369828538456204519", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh1p", "id": "-8086825754605075895", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh2p", "id": "-1240846623307703363", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh1p", "id": "1328044988541008574", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh2p", "id": "423352374077654603", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh1p", "id": "-8125087004296147185", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh2p", "id": "-1304572331748998803", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mcm1p", "id": "-1315948989039445051", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh2p", "id": "8449014129636267637", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mcm1p", "id": "6033492503581004132", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mcm1p", "id": "-6323523497498375186", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh", "id": "8260184393848373801", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mcm1p", "id": "968355688403583059", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh2p", "id": "-6957179791983390606", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh", "id": "1939569326074586635", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh1p", "id": "709335163067690593", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh2p", "id": "-2483565444075334621", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh", "id": "2134258288973569209", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Fkh", "id": "-4764598151164194013", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mcm1p", "id": "-3641101086825486197", "answers": [{"text": 1042, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 195, "answer_start": "interactions"}, {"text": 1276, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1373, "answer_start": "control"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Fkh2p", "id": "510532288474531351", "answers": [{"text": 1691, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 980, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 414, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Fkh1p", "id": "-7161241317642244534", "answers": [{"text": 1410, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1636, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1691, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 980, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 414, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Fkh", "id": "9020936282076130085", "answers": [{"text": 1939, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Mechanisms controlling differential promoter-occupancy by the yeast forkhead proteins Fkh1p and Fkh2p: implications for regulating the cell cycle and differentiation. \nThe roles of DNA and Mcm1p interactions in determining the overlapping and distinct functions of the yeast cell cycle regulatory transcription factors Fkh1p and Fkh2p were examined. Full-length recombinant Fkh1p and Fkh2p were purified and their binding to bona fide promoters examined in vitro. Each protein bound a variety of target promoters with similar specificity in vitro, consistent with the observation that these proteins bind common promoters in vivo. However, in vivo, the Fkh1p and Fkh2p occupied different target promoters to different extents, suggesting that each was primarily responsible for controlling a different set of genes. Additional in vitro studies provided a mechanistic explanation for this differential promoter-occupancy. Specifically, the Fkh2p, but not the Fkh1p, was capable of binding cooperatively with Mcm1p. The Mcm1p-Fkh2p cooperative binding was enhanced by, but did not require, the presence of a Mcm1p-binding site within a target promoter. Consistent with these data, Mcm1p was present at Fkh-controlled promoters in vivo regardless of whether they contained Mcm1p-binding sites, suggesting a role for Mcm1p at promoters not thought previously to be under Mcm1p control. Analysis of Fkh1p and Fkh2p binding to promoter targets in vivo by use of mutant strains indicated that the two proteins compete for promoter-occupancy at a number of target promoters. We postulate that Fkh1p and a stable Fkh2p/Mcm1p complex compete for binding to target promoters and that the levels and/or binding activity of Fkh1p, but not Fkh2p, are most limiting for promoter-occupancy in vivo. Interestingly, the in vitro DNA-binding assays, using a variety of promoter targets, revealed that bona fide Fkh target promoters contained two or more Fkh-binding sites that allowed the Fkh1p and Fkh2p proteins to form multiple protein-DNA complexes in vitro. Multiple Fkh-binding sites may be a distinguishing feature of bona fide Fkh promoters in yeast and other organisms."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event globotriaosylceramide/CD77 synthase", "id": "4190951868731554638", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)/CD77 synthase", "id": "5518868538547943684", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event alpha1,4-galactosyltransferase", "id": "-4633321533499792779", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event pVTR1", "id": "3455831411077421362", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event alpha1, 4-galactosyltransferase", "id": "-7252237873294284050", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Shiga-like toxins", "id": "-6307006880954009300", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event verotoxins", "id": "-2646081320462841211", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Gb3/CD77 synthase", "id": "6873691110566915759", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Molecular cloning of globotriaosylceramide/CD77 synthase, a glycosyltransferase that initiates the synthesis of globo series glycosphingolipids. \nThe expression cloning of a cDNA for globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)/CD77 synthase (alpha1,4-galactosyltransferase) was achieved using an anti-Gb3 antibody and mouse L cells as a recipient cell line for the transfection.

"p53-independent activation of the hdm2-P2 promoter through multiple transcription factor response elements results in elevated hdm2 expression in estrogen receptor alpha-positive breast cancer cells. \nThe negative-regulatory feedback loop between p53 and hdm2 forms part of a finely balanced regulatory network of proteins that controls cell cycle progression and commitment to apoptosis. Expression of hdm2, and its mouse orthologue mdm2, is known to be induced by p53, but recent evidence has demonstrated mdm2 expression can also be regulated via p53-independent pathways. However the p53 independent mechanisms that control transcription of the human hdm2 gene have not been studied. Differential levels of hdm2 mRNA and protein expression have been reported in several types of human malignancy, including breast cancers in which hdm2 expression correlates with positive estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) status. Experimental models have demonstrated that hdm2 overexpression can promote breast cancer development. Here, we show that the elevated level of hdm2 protein in ERalpha(+ve) breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 and T47D is because of transcription from the p53-inducible P2 promoter of hdm2. The P2 promoter is inactive in ERalpha(-ve) cell lines such as SKBr3. Hdm2-P2 promoter activity in T47D cells is independent of p53, as well as of known regulators of the mouse mdm2-P2 promoter, including ERalpha and ras-raf-mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. We show that hdm2-P2 activity in T47D cells is dependent on the integrity of both an evolutionarily conserved composite binding site for AP1 and ETS family transcription factors (AP1-ETS) and a nonconserved upstream (nnGGGGC)(5) repeat sequence. Lack of hdm2-P2 activity in ERalpha(-ve) cells is shown to be a consequence of reduced transcriptional activation through the AP1-ETS element. Overexpression of ETS2 in SKBr3 cells reconstitutes AP1-ETS element-dependent hdm2-P2 promoter activity, resulting in increased levels of hdm2 protein in the cells. Our findings support the hypothesis that the elevated levels of hdm2 expression reported in cancers such as ERalpha(+ve) breast tumors play an important role in the development of these tumors."},

through a complex of beta-catenin and the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of high-mobility-group transcription factors. Wnt stabilizes cytosolic beta-catenin, which then binds to TCF and activates gene transcription. This signalling cascade is conserved in vertebrates, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. In C. elegans, the proteins MOM-4 and LIT-1 regulate Wnt signalling to polarize responding cells during embryogenesis. MOM-4 and LIT-1 are homologous to TAK1 (a kinase activated by transforming growth factor-beta) mitogen-activated protein-kinase-kinase kinase (MAP3K) and MAP kinase (MAPK)-related NEMO-like kinase (NLK), respectively, in mammalian cells. These results raise the possibility that TAK1 and NLK are also involved in Wnt signalling in mammalian cells. Here we show that TAK1 activation stimulates NLK activity and downregulates transcriptional activation mediated by beta-catenin and TCF. Injection of NLK suppresses the induction of axis duplication by microinjected beta-catenin in Xenopus embryos. NLK phosphorylates TCF/LEF factors and inhibits the interaction of the beta-catenin-TCF complex with DNA. Thus, the TAK1-NLK-MAPK-like pathway negatively regulates the Wnt signalling pathway."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event cyclin dependent kinases", "id": "7200068008911994901", "answers": [],

of cell cycle regulation mechanisms has progressed very quickly these past few years and regulators of the cell cycle have gained widespread importance in cancer. This review first summarizes major advances in the understanding of the control of cell cycle mechanisms. Examples of how this control is altered in tumoral cells are then described. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: The typical mammalian cell cycle consists of four distinct phases occurring in a well-defined order, each of which should be completed successfully before the next begins. Progression of eukaryotic cells through major cell cycle transitions is mediated by sequential assembly and activation of a family of serine-threonine protein kinases, the cyclin dependent kinases (CDK). The timing of their activation is determined by their post-translational modifications (phosphorylations/dephosphorylations), and by the association of a protein called cyclin, which is the regulatory subunit of the kinase complex. The cyclin family is divided into two main classes. The 'G1 cyclins' include cyclins C, D1-3, and E, and their accumulation is rate-limiting for progression from the G1 to S phase. The 'mitotic or G2 cyclins', which include cyclin A and cyclin B, are involved in the control of G2/M transition and mitosis. The cyclins bind to and activate the CDK, which leads to phosphorylation (and then inhibition) of the tumor suppressor protein, pRb. pRb controls commitment to progress from the G1 to S phase, at least in part by repressing the activity of the E2F transcription factors known to promote cell proliferation. Both the D-type cyclins and their partner kinases CDK4/6 have proto-oncogenic properties, and their activity is carefully regulated at multiple levels including negative control by two families of CDK inhibitors. While members of the INK4 family (p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p18INK4C, p19INK4D) interact specifically with CDK4 and CDK6, the CIP/KIP inhibitors p21CIP1/WAF1, p27KIP1 and p57KIP2 inhibit a broader spectrum of CDK. The interplay between p16INK4A, cyclin D/CDK, and pRb/E2F together constitute a functional unit collectively known as the 'pRb pathway'. Each of the major components of this mechanism may become deregulated in cancer, and accumulating evidence points to the 'pRb pathway' as a candidate obligatory target in multistep oncogenesis of possibly all human tumor types. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: Major advances in the understanding of cell cycle regulation mechanisms provided a better knowledge of the molecular interactions involved in human cancer. This progress has led to the promotion of new therapeutic agents presently in clinical trials or under development. Moreover, the components of the cell cycle are probably involved in other non-cancerous diseases and their role must be defined."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event IKK gamma", "id": "7699450132966019179", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NEMO", "id": "6155281080126313807", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKK alpha", "id": "-1842684423418690926", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKK beta", "id": "6480591370749843445", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKK1", "id": "-2763003266300761977", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKK2", "id": "3276438244015776299", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NEMO", "id": "7839312721592682340", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKK gamma", "id": "6379030139578774539", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKK gamma", "id": "6331605826320886647", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Delta C-IKK gamma", "id": "238178150137136206", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event I kappa Bs", "id": "6031968612059716697", "answers": [{"text": 127, "answer_start": "Phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event I kappa B alpha", "id": "5589178372738642699", "answers": [{"text": 612, "answer_start": "phosphorylate"}, {"text": 312, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event I kappa B beta", "id": "1801813566452426044", "answers": [{"text": 612, "answer_start": "phosphorylate"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Delta C-IKK gamma 306", "id": "-947504230372721118", "answers": [{"text": 902, "answer_start": "expressed"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Delta C-IKK gamma 261", "id": "-8692900611664400701", "answers": [{"text": 902, "answer_start": "expressed"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Delta C-IKK gamma", "id": "-872195623952678893", "answers": [{"text": 980, "answer_start": "Overexpression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TNFalpha", "id": "-9200859870975311245", "answers": [{"text": 1198, "answer_start": "stimulation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Disruption of NF-kappa B signaling and chemokine gene activation by retroviral mediated expression of IKK gamma/NEMO mutants. \nPhosphorylation of I kappa Bs--the cytoplasmic inhibitors of the NF-kappa B transcription factors--is the key event which triggers activation of the NF-kappa B cascade. Signal-mediated phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha is mediated by a multiprotein complex, the I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of at least three identified subunits. Two of these polypeptides, IKK alpha and IKK beta, also known as IKK1 and IKK2, are the catalytic subunits of the kinase complex and phosphorylate I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta. The third component, NEMO/IKK gamma, does not exhibit kinase activity, but rather constitutes a regulatory subunit. In the present study, C-terminal truncated forms of IKK gamma--Delta C-IKK gamma 306 and Delta C-IKK gamma 261--were stably expressed in the myeloid cell line U937 by retroviral-mediated gene transfer. Overexpression of Delta C-IKK gamma resulted in a reduction in IKK kinase activity in vitro, a subsequent decrease in NF-kappa B DNA binding activity, and inhibition of chemokine gene induction in response to TNFalpha stimulation or paramyxovirus infection. This study demonstrates the efficacy of Delta C-IKK gamma as a repressor of IKK signaling and NF-kappa B activation and suggests a potential gene therapy approach to limit chronic inflammation due to chemokine hyperactivation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event mTOR", "id": "1777887835849392626", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (PGC)-1alpha", "id": "1017836795786700793", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mammalian target of rapamycin", "id": "-6996794925553572722", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "-8400356218056165161", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "-3502802824619299462", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "-315338419900667016", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event yin-yang 1", "id": "-6890187605618234522", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event YY1", "id": "90269463343451389", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "5768917658481199532", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PGC-1alpha", "id": "-9124850517681064433", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event YY1", "id": "4868791768402662809", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PGC-1alpha", "id": "-2455384650831682346", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "6817835438509546761", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "3184959794640490755", "answers": [{"text": 1317, "answer_start": "inhibition"}, {"text": 708, "answer_start": "inhibitor"}, {"text": 1368, "answer_start": "interact"}, {"text": 1389, "answer_start": "coactivated"}, {"text": 1292, "answer_start": "interacted"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event oestrogen-related receptor alpha", "id": "-1834154884032182232", "answers": [{"text": 742, "answer_start": "gene expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PGC-1alpha", "id": "2528298196106925821", "answers": [{"text": 742, "answer_start": "gene expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event YY1", "id": "-3553830531019399210", "answers": [{"text": 1368, "answer_start": "interact"}, {"text": 1094, "answer_start": "Knockdown"}, {"text": 1292, "answer_start": "interacted"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event raptor", "id": "-3693996882784029656", "answers": [{"text": 1292, "answer_start": "interacted"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "mTOR controls mitochondrial oxidative function through a YY1-PGC-1alpha transcriptional complex. \nTranscriptional complexes that contain peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (PGC)-1alpha control mitochondrial oxidative function to maintain energy homeostasis in response to nutrient and hormonal signals. An important component in the energy and nutrient pathways is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that regulates cell growth, size and survival. However, it is unknown whether and how mTOR controls mitochondrial oxidative activities. Here we show that mTOR is necessary for the maintenance of mitochondrial oxidative function. In skeletal muscle tissues and cells, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin decreased the gene expression of the mitochondrial transcriptional regulators PGC-1alpha, oestrogen-related receptor alpha and nuclear respiratory factors, resulting in a decrease in mitochondrial gene expression and oxygen consumption. Using computational genomics, we identified the transcription factor yin-yang 1 (YY1) as a common target of mTOR and PGC-1alpha. Knockdown of YY1 caused a significant decrease in mitochondrial gene expression and in respiration, and YY1 was required for rapamycin-dependent repression of those genes. Moreover, mTOR and raptor interacted with YY1, and inhibition of mTOR resulted in a failure of YY1 to interact with and be coactivated by PGC-1alpha. We have therefore identified a mechanism by which a nutrient sensor (mTOR) balances energy metabolism by means of the transcriptional control of mitochondrial oxidative function. These results have important implications for our understanding of how these pathways might be altered in metabolic diseases and cancer."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event SDF-1alpha", "id":

interleukin-6 through CXCR4, PI3K/Akt, ERK, and NF-kappaB-dependent pathway in microglia. \nStromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), also known as CXCL12, and its receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) express in various kinds of cells in central nervous system. The SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway is regulated by diverse biological effects. SDF-1 is up-regulated in the ischemic penumbra following stroke and has been known to be associated with the homing of bone marrow cells to injury. However, the effect of SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 on cytokine production in microglia is mostly unknown. Here, we demonstrated that SDF-1alpha enhanced IL-6 production in both primary cultured microglia and BV-2 microglia. We further investigated the signaling pathway involved in IL-6 production stimulated by SDF-1alpha in microglia. SDF-1alpha increased IL-6 production in both protein and mRNA levels. These effects were attenuated by ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), NF-kappaB inhibitors, and IkappaB protease inhibitor. Stimulation of microglia with SDF-1alpha also increased Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, SDF-1alpha treatment also increased IkappaB kinase alpha/beta (IKK alpha/beta) phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, p65 phosphorylation at Ser(276), translocation of p65 and p50 from cytosol to nucleus and kappaB-luciferase activity. Moreover, SDF-1alpha-mediated increase of kappaB-luciferase activity was inhibited by pre-transfection of DN-p85, DN-Akt or DN-ERK2. Increase of IKK alpha/beta phosphorylation and binding of p65 and p50 to the NF-kappaB element were both antagonized by PI3K and ERK inhibitors. Our results demonstrate a mechanism linking SDF-1alpha and IL-6, and provide additional support for the notion that SDF-1alpha plays a regulatory role in microglia activation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Toll-like receptor 2", "id": "-5097470255500360393", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll-like receptors", "id": "3588919267037603041", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLRs", "id": "6470521900649980493", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event pertussis toxin", "id": "5455981235289695442", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-4626554578992205681", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "7897465092239986208", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase", "id": "-5909957110347068639", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PI3-K", "id": "4043820155064106245", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event phospholipase C", "id": "-6149594921318729388", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PLC", "id": "5628155636462072606", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PKC", "id": "-7309778356201735669", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event extra-cellular signal regulated kinase", "id": "4361059296922455928", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ERK", "id": "4307728438655402801", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "3859818394314229045", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PI3-K", "id": "-8036664802745037392", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PLC", "id": "-3467262043831049706", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PKC", "id": "1117585337336298491", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ERK", "id": "6224842998266314836", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein kinase C", "id": "1399500731855574067", "answers": [{"text": 515, "answer_start": "inhibitor"}, {"text": 799, "answer_start": "dependent"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PLC", "id": "-5357481072341512583", "answers": [{"text": 981, "answer_start": "inhibitor"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PI3-K", "id": "1625852720176251448", "answers": [{"text": 1013, "answer_start": "inhibitor"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event ERK", "id": "4033697379211751886", "answers": [{"text": 1042, "answer_start": "inhibitor"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PKC", "id": "-7331094601116497561", "answers": [{"text": 1069, "answer_start": "inhibitor"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "5539879435502087126", "answers": [{"text": 1236, "answer_start": "Activated"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Pharmacological analysis of signal transduction pathways required for oxidative burst in chicken heterophils stimulated by a Toll-like receptor 2 agonist. \nToll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the innate immune response of avian heterophils.

In its inactive state, NF-kappaB is constitutively present in the cytoplasm as a p50-p65 heterodimer bound to its inhibitory protein IkappaB. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), activate NF-kappaB by stimulating the activity of the IkappaB kinases (IKKs) which phosphorylate IkappaBalpha on serine residues 32 and 36, targeting it for rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome. This enables the release and nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB complex and activation of gene transcription. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine that controls inflammatory processes by suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines which are known to be transcriptionally controlled by NF-kappaB. Conflicting data exists on the effects of IL-10 on TNF- and LPS-induced NF-kappaB activity in human monocytes and the molecular mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. In this study, we show that IL-10 functions to block NF-kappaB activity at two levels: 1) through the suppression of IKK activity and 2) through the inhibition of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity.

Toll-interacting protein and IL-1 receptor signaling molecules in Toll-like receptor 2 signaling. \nToll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 play important roles in innate immune responses to various microbial agents. We have previously shown that human dermal endothelial cells (HMEC) express TLR4, but very little TLR2, and respond to LPS, but not to Mycobacterium tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein, unless transfected with TLR2. Here we report that HMEC are unresponsive to several additional biologically relevant TLR2 ligands, including, phenol-soluble modulin (PSM), a complex of three small secreted polypeptides from the skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis, soluble tuberculosis factor (STF), and Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein A lipoprotein (OspA-L). Expression of TLR2 renders HMEC responsive to all these ligands. We further characterized the signaling pathway in response to STF, OspA-L, and PSM in TLR2-transfected HMEC. The TLR2 signaling pathway for NF-kappaB trans-activation shares the IL-1R signaling molecules. Dominant negative constructs of TLR2 or TLR6 inhibit the responses of STF and OspA-L as well as PSM in TLR2-transfected HMEC, supporting the concept of functional cooperation between TLR2 and TLR6 for all these TLR2 ligands. Moreover, we show that Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) coimmunoprecipitates with TLR2 and TLR4 using HEK 293 cells, and overexpression of Tollip inhibits NF-kappaB activation in response to TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Collectively, these findings suggest that there is functional interaction between TLR2 and TLR6 in the cellular response to STF and OspA-L in addition to S. epidermidis (PSM) Ags, and that engagement of TLR2 triggers a signaling cascade, which shares the IL-1R signaling molecules, similar to the TLR4-LPS signaling cascade. Our data also suggest that Tollip may be an important constituent of both the TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event p105", "id": "-5303654335697250727", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Bcl-3", "id": "3483140940019458253", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event I kappa B", "id": "-8321087247476648516", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event I kappa B", "id": "-3201343225540252771", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "6368826161690345509", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p65", "id": "1921727570732376857", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "-6340331472482596875", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "4081461370649579302", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ankyrin", "id": "-3445410964420221451", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Bcl-3", "id": "-2845159411694010925", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p65", "id": "4563602551153998131", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Bcl-3", "id": "5427673044437791427", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event I kappa B", "id": "4260076107494432844", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "-1184485984394507574", "answers": [{"text": 971, "answer_start": "assembly"}, {"text": 272, "answer_start": "associates"}, {"text": 330, "answer_start": "assembly"}, {"text": 162, "answer_start": "interaction"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "-2516484583913148114", "answers": [{"text": 661, "answer_start": "translocation"}, {"text": 717, "answer_start": "retained"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p65", "id": "-7315334046021187796", "answers": [{"text": 661, "answer_start": "translocation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event -beta", "id": "-2760108451762637265", "answers": [{"text": 800, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Bcl-3", "id": "-394261065071776288", "answers": [{"text": 800, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event I kappa B alpha", "id": "-3465212182728214461", "answers": [{"text": 800, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The NF-kappa B precursor p105 and the proto-oncogene product Bcl-3 are I kappa B molecules and control nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. \nWe have examined the interaction of the NF-kappa B precursor p105 with NF-kappa B subunits. Similar to an I kappa B molecule, p105 associates in the cytoplasm with p50 or p65. Through this assembly, p105 efficiently blocks nuclear transfer of either subunit. Moreover, the p105 protein inhibits DNA binding of dimeric NF-kappa B subunits in a similar, but not identical, manner to its isolated C-terminal domain, which contains an ankyrin-like repeat domain (ARD). The proto-oncogene product Bcl-3 also controls nuclear translocation of p50, but not of p65.

The proteins encoded by these genes, EXT1 and EXT2, are endoplasmic reticulum-localized type II transmembrane glycoproteins that possess or are tightly associated with glycosyltransferase activities involved in the polymerization of heparan sulfate. Here, by testing a cell line with a specific defect in EXT1 in in vivo and in vitro assays, we show that EXT2 does not harbor significant glycosyltransferase activity in the absence of EXT1. Instead, it appears that EXT1 and EXT2 form a hetero-oligomeric complex in vivo that leads to the accumulation of both proteins in the Golgi apparatus. Remarkably, the Golgi-localized EXT1/EXT2 complex possesses substantially higher glycosyltransferase activity than EXT1 or EXT2 alone, which suggests that the complex represents the biologically relevant form of the enzyme(s).

in a variety of functions in the yeast life cycle, including septin organization for cytokinesis, pheromone response, and haploid invasive growth. A group of proteins called GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thereby inactivating Cdc42. At the time this study began, there was one known GAP, Bem3, and one putative GAP, Rga1, for Cdc42. We identified another putative GAP for Cdc42 and named it Rga2 (Rho GTPase-activating protein 2). We confirmed by genetic and biochemical criteria that Rga1, Rga2, and Bem3 act as GAPs for Cdc42. A detailed characterization of Rga1, Rga2, and Bem3 suggested that they regulate different subsets of Cdc42 function. In particular, deletion of the individual GAPs conferred different phenotypes. For example, deletion of RGA1, but not RGA2 or BEM3, caused hyperinvasive growth. Furthermore, overproduction or loss of Rga1 and Rga2, but not Bem3, affected the two-hybrid interaction of Cdc42 with Ste20, a p21-activated kinase (PAK) kinase required for haploid invasive growth. These results suggest Rga1, and possibly Rga2, facilitate the interaction of Cdc42 with Ste20 to mediate signaling in the haploid invasive growth pathway. Deletion of BEM3 resulted in cells with severe morphological defects not observed in rga1delta or rga2delta strains.

In view of the important role of cGMP for cardiovascular function, expression of this transport protein in human heart is of relevance. We analyzed the expression and localization of MRP5 in human heart [21 auricular (AS) and 15 left ventricular samples (LV) including 5 samples of dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy]. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction normalized to beta-actin revealed expression of the MRP5 gene in all samples (LV, 38.5 +/- 12.9; AS, 12.7 +/- 5.6; P < 0.001). An MRP5-specific polyclonal antibody detected a glycoprotein of approximately 190 kd in crude cell membrane fractions from these samples. Immunohistochemistry with the affinity-purified antibody revealed localization of MRP5 in cardiomyocytes as well as in cardiovascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we could detect MRP5 and ATP-dependent transport of [(3)H]cGMP in sarcolemma vesicles of human heart. Quantitative analysis of the immunoblots indicated an interindividual variability with a higher expression of MRP5 in the ischemic (104 +/- 38% of recombinant MRP5 standard) compared to normal ventricular samples (53 +/- 36%, P < 0.05).

The potential for PTEN to regulate the synthesis of RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcription products, including tRNAs and 5S rRNAs, was evaluated. The expression of PTEN in PTEN-deficient cells repressed RNA Pol III transcription, whereas decreased PTEN expression enhanced transcription. Transcription repression by PTEN was uncoupled from PTEN-mediated effects on the cell cycle and was independent of p53. PTEN acts through its lipid phosphatase activity, inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K pathway to decrease transcription. PTEN, through the inactivation of mTOR, targets the TFIIIB complex, disrupting the association between TATA-binding protein and Brf1. Kinetic analysis revealed that PTEN initially induces a decrease in the serine phosphorylation of Brf1, leading to a selective reduction in the occupancy of all TFIIIB subunits on tRNA(Leu) genes, whereas prolonged PTEN expression results in the enhanced serine phosphorylation of Bdp1.

In children, it causes otitis media, the most common childhood infection and the leading cause of conductive hearing loss in the United States. In adults, it causes lower respiratory tract infections in the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NTHi-induced infections remain undefined, but they may involve activation of NF-kappa B, a transcriptional activator of multiple host defense genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Here, we show that NTHi strongly activates NF-kappa B in human epithelial cells via two distinct signaling pathways, NF-kappa B translocation-dependent and -independent pathways. The NF-kappa B translocation-dependent pathway involves activation of NF-kappa B inducing kinase (NIK)--IKK alpha/beta complex leading to I kappa B alpha phosphorylation and degradation, whereas the NF-kappa B translocation-independent pathway involves activation of MKK3/6--p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Bifurcation of NTHi-induced NIK-IKK alpha/beta-I kappa B alpha and MKK3/6--p38 MAP kinase pathways may occur at transforming growth factor-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1). Furthermore, we show that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is required for NTHi-induced NF-kappa B activation. In addition, several key inflammatory mediators including IL-1 beta, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha are up-regulated by NTHi. Finally, P6, a 16-kDa lipoprotein highly conserved in the outer membrane of all NTHi and H. influenzae type b strains, appears to also activate NF-kappa B via similar signaling pathways. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NTHi activates NF-kappa B via TLR2-TAK1-dependent NIK--IKK alpha/beta-I kappa B alpha and MKK3/6--p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways.

We demonstrate that the dual-specificity kinase Mps1p is essential for the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of Spc110p in vivo and that Mps1p phosphorylates Spc110p in vitro. Phosphopeptides generated by proteolytic cleavage were identified and sequenced by mass spectrometry. Ser(60), Thr(64), and Thr(68) are the major sites in Spc110p phosphorylated by Mps1p in vitro, and alanine substitution at these sites abolishes the mitosis-specific isoform in vivo. This is the first time that phosphorylation sites of an SPB component have been determined, and these are the first sites of Mps1p phosphorylation identified. Alanine substitution for any one of these phosphorylated residues, in conjunction with an alanine substitution at residue Ser(36), is lethal in combination with alleles of SPC97, which encodes a component of the Tub4p complex.

The main transcriptional activator that orchestrates this response is Msn2, whose nuclear localization and DNA binding are negatively controlled by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Msn2 activation by sudden glucose depletion correlates with a fast but transient decrease in phosphorylation of several sites in its nuclear localization signal (NLS). Here we show that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is the direct antagonist of PKA-dependent phosphorylation at the Msn2 nuclear import domain and therefore a potential mediator of glucose starvation signals that target this transcription factor. Apart from PKA, the protein kinase Snf1 can also directly modify one of the Msn2 phosphorylation sites (S582) and thereby repress Msn2 function. Consequently, in snf1 mutants, rephosphorylation of the NLS happens to be much slower during prolonged starvation. Thus, a second, Reg1-dependent form of PP1 indirectly influences Msn2 functionality by modulating Snf1 kinase activation and repression. Different activities of PP1 are therefore involved in shaping induction and adaptation of the transcriptional stress response during acute glucose starvation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event FUS3", "id": "-5914921081365817968", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event KSS1", "id": "5048303941206870381", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP kinases", "id": "5806465993520404497", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event STE11", "id": "2904828417779829599", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event STE7", "id": "-5234679458996419205", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event STE7", "id": "-4257186453282383169", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event STE11", "id": "-161800967831485573", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event KSS1", "id": "4324090757233814962", "answers": [{"text": 263, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}, {"text": 80, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event FUS3", "id": "-4326330550199927063", "answers": [{"text": 263, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}, {"text": 701, "answer_start": "modification"}, {"text": 344, "answer_start": "modification"}, {"text": 80, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 843, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 975, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event STE11", "id": "4550325111520465471", "answers": [{"text": 798, "answer_start": "hyperactive"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Signal transduction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation of FUS3 and KSS1. \nThe FUS3 and KSS1 kinases are components of the pheromone-dependent signal transduction pathway in yeast.

Key target genes in this process include master regulators of the cell cycle, such as cyclin E, which regulates G(1) progression, and cyclin A, which is required for the initiation of DNA synthesis. In the present work, we present novel evidence that a second G(1) cyclin, cyclin D3, is also potently activated by E2F1. First, an estrogen receptor-E2F1 fusion protein (ER-E2F1) potently activates the endogenous cyclin D3 mRNA upon treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which induces nuclear accumulation of the otherwise cytosolic fusion protein. Furthermore, trans-activation of cyclin D3 by ER-E2F1 occurs even in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and thus appears direct. Second, all of the growth-stimulatory members of the E2F family (E2F1, -2, and -3A) potently activate a cyclin D3 promoter reporter, whereas growth-restraining members of the family (E2F4, -5, and -6) have little effect. Third, recombinant E2F1 binds with high affinity to the cyclin D3 promoter in vitro. Fourth, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that endogenous E2F1 is associated with the cyclin D3 promoter in vivo. Finally, mapping experiments localize the essential E2F regulatory element of the cyclin D3 promoter to a noncanonical E2F site in the promoter between nucleotides -143 and -135 relative to the initiating methionine codon. We conclude that in addition to cyclins E and A, E2F family members can also activate one member of the D-type cyclins, further contributing to the ability of the stimulatory E2F family members to drive cellular proliferation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Mpk1", "id": "-8608499688349709966", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP kinase", "id": "5446323231052540359", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mpk1", "id": "-3259095800784772643", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP kinase", "id": "-7791948956017438976", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rlm1", "id": "-9075828677231137818", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MEF2", "id": "8306816603271598667", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rlm1", "id": "4191227474659446412", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event lacZ", "id": "-3715436843903258738", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rlm1", "id": "-2513845827116936009", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rlm1", "id": "4996400625754660242", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP kinase", "id": "5639871991033815998", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rlm1", "id": "-6305555933288735040", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mpk1", "id": "-931365031480893320", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rlm1", "id": "412336521064894937", "answers": [{"text": 186, "answer_start": "phosphorylates"}, {"text": 205, "answer_start": "activates"}, {"text": 1047, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 1092, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1413, "answer_start": "resides"}, {"text": 882, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 1572, "answer_start": "transcriptional activation"}, {"text": 1611, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 0, "answer_start": "Regulation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Mpk1", "id": "-3457217062050422667", "answers": [{"text": 705, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MEF2A", "id": "-5664908119822561199", "answers": [{"text": 1179, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MEF2C", "id": "-1865966092309296730", "answers": [{"text": 1179, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Regulation of the yeast Rlm1 transcription factor by the Mpk1 cell wall integrity MAP kinase. \nThe Mpk1 MAP kinase of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall integrity signalling pathway phosphorylates and activates the Rlm1 transcription factor in response to cell wall stress.

Signalling through Rlm1 regulates the expression of at least 25 genes, most of which have been implicated in cell wall biogenesis. We report here the transcriptional induction by agents of cell wall stress of a set of lacZ reporter plasmids derived from several Rlm1-responsive genes. Analysis of substitution mutations at putative Mpk1 phosphorylation sites within Rlm1 revealed that Ser427 and Thr439 are important for its stress-induced transcriptional activation of these reporter plasmids. Assessment of Rlm1 activation potency when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain showed that the identified seryl and threonyl residues are necessary for the Rlm1 transcriptional activation function independently of its DNA binding. We also demonstrate that a MAP kinase docking site, shown recently to mediate activation of MEF2A and MEF2C, is conserved in Rlm1 and is required for its ability to mediate transcriptional activation in response to agents that induce cell wall stress. Finally, intracellular localization analyses show that Rlm1 resides in the nucleus regardless of its activation and phosphorylation status. Together these observations support the inference that Mpk1 regulates the Rlm1 transcriptional activation function by phosphorylation of Ser427 and Thr439."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event nim1", "id": "-6222682897621900316", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cdr1", "id": "-1462303655860712592", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event wee1", "id": "8559376040040531673", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event nim1", "id": "-7082075326748452121", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cdr1", "id": "-3006962606740179438", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event wee1", "id": "7888290697027133186", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event nim1", "id": "8505110417327568448", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event nim1", "id": "-4838501711886098088", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cdc2", "id": "-5237263051005734653", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event nim1", "id": "-3985063026287516840", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event nim1", "id": "936266623942946772", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event wee1", "id": "7800657793650389081", "answers": [{"text": 1050, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 0, "answer_start": "Negative regulation"}, {"text": 825, "answer_start": "inhibition"}, {"text": 653, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1112, "answer_start": "inhibitory"}, {"text": 562, "answer_start": "phosphorylate"}, {"text": 748, "answer_start": "drop"}, {"text": 1027, "answer_start": "negative regulation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p34cdc2", "id": "-2828380348358963099", "answers": [{"text": 194, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event nim1", "id": "1174837810305810048", "answers": [{"text": 498, "answer_start": "autophosphorylates"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Negative regulation of the wee1 protein kinase by direct action of the nim1/cdr1 mitotic inducer. \nThe wee1 protein kinase suppresses the entry into mitosis by mediating the inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2.

Our previous study showed that overexpression of Notch1 could inhibit human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell growth by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. HCC cells are resistant to apoptotic induction by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), so new therapeutic approaches have been explored to sensitize HCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We are wondering whether and how Notch1 signaling can enhance the sensitivity of HCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In this study, we found that overexpression of ICN, the constitutive activated form of Notch1, up-regulated p53 protein expression in HCC cells by inhibiting proteasome degradation. p53 up-regulation was further observed in human primary hepatocellular carcinoma cells after activation of Notch signaling. Inhibition of the Akt/Hdm2 pathway by Notch1 signaling was responsible for the suppression of p53 proteasomal degradation, thus contributing to the Notch1 signaling-mediated up-regulation of p53 expression. Accordingly, Notch1 signaling could make HCC cells more sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas Notch1 signaling lost the synergistic promotion of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in p53-silenced HepG2 HCC cells and p53-defective Hep3B HCC cells. The data suggest that enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by Notch1 signaling is dependent upon p53 up-regulation. Furthermore, Notch1 signaling could enhance DR5 expression in a p53-dependent manner. Taken together, Notch1 signaling sensitizes TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCC cells by inhibiting Akt/Hdm2-mediated p53 degradation and up-regulating p53-dependent DR5 expression. Thus, our results suggest that activation of Notch1 signaling may be a promising approach to improve the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL-resistant HCC."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Interleukin-1", "id": "-6018673686443559899", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IL-1", "id": "-1674231559966689208", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event tumor necrosis factor", "id": "-1681357643952198903", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "6712251160951431188", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAP kinases", "id": "2146381807848289723", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "4346225140210841455", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IL-1", "id": "-7133756538397997035", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF2", "id": "-7173577924339585462", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "9129192234876993422", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF", "id": "-3512880206337589281", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF2", "id": "7861284298326150180", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "3265079163298282504", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event FKBP12", "id": "4004481521241224656", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "1690112458003566221", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IL-1", "id": "-126368855301813007", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "2475943621238465739", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MEKK1", "id": "-4090263811402714464", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "4683456274269442671", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IL-1", "id": "-3737828524045067735", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "-489002544229438266", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "-8049559831569653172", "answers": [{"text": 471, "answer_start": "Overexpressed"}, {"text": 40, "answer_start": "oligomerization"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TRAF2", "id": "7675759804367878243", "answers": [{"text": 471, "answer_start": "Overexpressed"}, {"text": 40, "answer_start": "oligomerization"}, {"text": 1131, "answer_start": "oligomerization"}, {"text": 778, "answer_start": "Oligomerization"}, {"text": 1001, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event JNK", "id": "-8425306486120050917", "answers": [{"text": 300, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 105, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 500, "answer_start": "activate"}, {"text": 907, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event AP-1", "id": "8405791472705761064", "answers": [{"text": 241, "answer_start": "stimulate"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p38", "id": "-7756802504593851638", "answers": [{"text": 300, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 500, "answer_start": "activate"}, {"text": 907, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MEKK1", "id": "-2968274615177574051", "answers": [{"text": 843, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Signaling by proinflammatory cytokines: oligomerization of TRAF2 and TRAF6 is sufficient for JNK and IKK activation and target gene induction via an amino-terminal effector domain. \nInterleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) stimulate transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB through activation of the MAP kinases JNK and p38 and the IkappaB kinase (IKK), respectively.

Under basal conditions, RSK1 is located in the cytosol and upon stimulation, RSK1 translocates to the plasma membrane where it is fully activated. The ability of RSK1 to bind the adapter protein 14-3-3beta was investigated because RSK1 contains several putative 14-3-3-binding motifs. We demonstrate that RSK1 specifically and directly binds 14-3-3beta. This interaction was dependent on phosphorylation of serine 154 within the motif RLSKEV of RSK1. Binding of RSK1 to 14-3-3beta was maximal under basal conditions and decreased significantly upon mitogen stimulation. After 5 min of serum stimulation, a portion of 14-3-3beta and RSK1 translocated to the membrane fraction, and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated colocalization of RSK1 and 14-3-3beta at the plasma membrane in vivo. Incubation of recombinant RSK1 with 14-3-3beta decreased RSK1 kinase activity by approximately 50%. Mutation of RSK1 serine 154 increased both basal and serum-stimulated RSK activity. In addition, the epidermal growth factor response of RSK1S154A was enhanced compared with wild type RSK.

Increased phosphorylation of two sites essential for RSK1 kinase activity (Ser(380) and Ser(363)) in RSK1S154A compared with RSK1 wild type, demonstrated that 14-3-3 interferes with RSK1 phosphorylation.

The importance of proper control of mRNA translation is strikingly illustrated by the fact that defects in this process or its control are implicated in a number of disease states, such as cancer, tissue hypertrophy and neurodegeneration. Signalling pathways such as those involving mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and mitogen-activated protein kinases modulate the phosphorylation of translation factors, the activities of the protein kinases that act upon them and the association of RNA-binding proteins with specific mRNAs. These effects contribute both to the overall control of protein synthesis (which is linked to cell growth) and to the modulation of the translation or stability of specific mRNAs. However, important questions remain about both the contributions of individual regulatory events to the control of general protein synthesis and the mechanisms by which the translation of specific mRNAs is controlled."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event transcription adaptor", "id": "1202676959677131018", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Esa1p", "id": "-2417440578698871033", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ATM", "id": "-1342401381170234179", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Tra1p", "id": "-4921319732502485032", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ESA1", "id": "-949690659238099443", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Esa1p", "id": "-8842275071718578646", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event esa1", "id": "1525193562802549504", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ATM", "id": "5241149558366091962", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRRAP", "id": "-2141726561544054159", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event c-Myc", "id": "7215406957173365934", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-2001405405628032250", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event GAL4-VP16", "id": "2874948426959560604", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event esa1", "id": "-3405725268328743008", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Esa1", "id": "5605983258536045570", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HAT", "id": "-2937780636296274640", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Tra1p", "id": "6007964134012256304", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event histone H4 acetyltransferase", "id": "-2237308205736292773", "answers": [{"text": 78, "answer_start": "containing"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event histone H4", "id": "8850407856778178315", "answers": [{"text": 151, "answer_start": "acetylation"}, {"text": 517, "answer_start": "acetylated"}, {"text": 386, "answer_start": "acetylates"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TRA1", "id": "558342589203647238", "answers": [{"text": 993, "answer_start": "essential"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event H4", "id": "6896795351885909725", "answers": [{"text": 1472, "answer_start": "acetylation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "NuA4, an essential transcription adaptor/histone H4 acetyltransferase complex containing Esa1p and the ATM-related cofactor Tra1p. \nPost-translational acetylation of histone H4 N-terminal tail in chromatin has been associated with several nuclear processes including transcription.

We show that A20 does not inhibit TNF- induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-kappaB, although it completely prevents the TNF- induced activation of an NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene, as well as TNF-induced IL-6 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor gene expression. Moreover, NF-kappaB activation induced by overexpression of the TNF receptor-associated proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD), receptor interacting protein (RIP), and TNF recep- tor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) was also inhibited by expression of A20, whereas NF-kappaB activation induced by overexpression of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) or the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax was unaffected. These results demonstrate that A20 inhibits NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression by interfering with a novel TNF-induced and RIP- or TRAF2-mediated pathway that is different from the NIK-IkappaB kinase pathway and that is specifically involved in the transactivation of NF-kappaB.

Here we show that insulin decreases the ability of eEF2 kinase to bind calmodulin in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. We identify a novel phosphorylation site in eEF2 kinase (Ser78) that is located immediately next to its calmodulin-binding motif. Phosphorylation of this site is increased by insulin in a rapamycin-sensitive fashion. Regulation of the phosphorylation of Ser78 also requires amino acids and the protein kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1. Mutation of this site to alanine strongly attenuates the effects of insulin and rapamycin both on the binding of calmodulin to eEF2 kinase and on eEF2 kinase activity. Phosphorylation of Ser78 is thus likely to link insulin and mTOR signaling to the control of eEF2 phosphorylation and chain elongation. This site is not a target for known kinases in the mTOR pathway, e.g., the S6 kinases, implying that it is phosphorylated by a novel mTOR-linked protein kinase that serves to couple hormones and amino acids to the control of translation elongation. eEF2 kinase is thus a target for mTOR signaling independently of previously known downstream components of the pathway."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Nerve growth factor", "id": "-1057148207047034779", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NGF", "id": "-7269273547997080354", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NGF", "id": "2369921244096426484", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-2685832491092376071", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NGF", "id": "6960819014651419824", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NGF", "id": "119590819480601954", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NGF", "id": "8143805245039366116", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NGF", "id": "2228156323544066922", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NGF", "id": "4436506487959679", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Waf1", "id": "-1646801482081908099", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cip1", "id": "3289168273727449145", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "8162181431180526998", "answers": [{"text": 550, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 330, "answer_start": "influence"}, {"text": 766, "answer_start": "silenced"}, {"text": 511, "answer_start": "localization"}, {"text": 40, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1114, "answer_start": "altering"}, {"text": 481, "answer_start": "increased"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event caspases 1", "id": "4236460854795994902", "answers": [{"text": 634, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event 10", "id": "-5159853154537657306", "answers": [{"text": 634, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event survivin", "id": "7472515798919636165", "answers": [{"text": 830, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PUMA", "id": "-2873071919047959044", "answers": [{"text": 830, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "-8369591327615969102", "answers": [{"text": 1054, "answer_start": "increasing"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Bcl-2", "id": "-1224272659904880145", "answers": [{"text": 1054, "answer_start": "increasing"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event caspase", "id": "-9005011361311420461", "answers": [{"text": 1201, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Nerve growth factor potentiates p53 DNA binding but inhibits nitric oxide-induced apoptosis in neuronal PC12 cells. \nNGF is recognized for its role in neuronal differentiation and maintenance.

Different cyclins promote distinct cell-cycle events, but the molecular basis for these differences remains unclear. Here we compare the specificity of two budding yeast cyclins, the S-phase cyclin Clb5 and the M-phase cyclin Clb2, in the phosphorylation of 150 Cdk1 (Cdc28) substrates. About 24% of these proteins were phosphorylated more efficiently by Clb5-Cdk1 than Clb2-Cdk1. The Clb5-specific targets include several proteins (Sld2, Cdc6, Orc6, Mcm3 and Cdh1) involved in early S-phase events. Clb5 specificity depended on an interaction between a hydrophobic patch in Clb5 and a short sequence in the substrate (the RXL or Cy motif). Phosphorylation of Clb5-specific targets during S phase was reduced by replacing Clb5 with Clb2 or by mutating the substrate RXL motif, confirming the importance of Clb5 specificity in vivo. Although we did not identify any highly Clb2-specific substrates, we found that Clb2-Cdk1 possessed higher intrinsic kinase activity than Clb5-Cdk1, enabling efficient phosphorylation of a broad range of mitotic Cdk1 targets. Thus, Clb5 and Clb2 use distinct mechanisms to enhance the phosphorylation of S-phase and M-phase substrates."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event SWI5", "id": "665656927968286422", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ACE2", "id": "4303062196044536440", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SWI5", "id": "6966044663815198670", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SWI5", "id": "6566566216608753241", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SWI5", "id": "-3332287014280005834", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ACE2", "id": "7691118346626357028", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SWI5", "id": "-1473374069303659464", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ACE2", "id": "-4965165152112852475", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ACE2", "id": "5594095946034952431", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event chitinase", "id": "5957209319678884948", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SWI5", "id": "4267923893023474466", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SWI5", "id": "2088549344262988769", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HO", "id": "5644598087820261576", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ACE2", "id": "6103542194154169331", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event CTS1", "id": "4033292868766465724", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SWI4", "id": "-6124882471214428542", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SWI6", "id": "-3746764918681940192", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SWI5/ACE2", "id": "3410018120671774834", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event chitinase", "id": "-8206104584471161856", "answers": [{"text": 97, "answer_start": "transcription"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event HO", "id": "1060730238680436259", "answers": [{"text": 745, "answer_start": "activator"}, {"text": 1036, "answer_start": "regulated"}, {"text": 1084, "answer_start": "require"}, {"text": 97, "answer_start": "transcription"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event SWI5", "id": "6328224834176228927", "answers": [{"text": 370, "answer_start": "localization"}, {"text": 343, "answer_start": "transcription"}, {"text": 1138, "answer_start": "Overproduction"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event ACE2", "id": "-8446361740253938491", "answers": [{"text": 560, "answer_start": "localization"}, {"text": 1138, "answer_start": "Overproduction"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event CTS1", "id": "5413038256393177239", "answers": [{"text": 844, "answer_start": "activator"}, {"text": 1036, "answer_start": "regulated"}, {"text": 1084, "answer_start": "require"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Parallel pathways of gene regulation: homologous regulators SWI5 and ACE2 differentially control transcription of HO and chitinase. \nTwo independent pathways of transcriptional regulation that show functional homology have been identified in yeast.

We show that ACE2, whose zinc finger region is nearly identical to that of SWI5, shows patterns of cell cycle-regulated transcription and nuclear localization similar to those seen previously for SWI5. Despite their similarities, SWI5 and ACE2 function in separate pathways of transcriptional regulation. SWI5 is a transcriptional activator of the HO endonuclease gene, whereas ACE2 is not. In contrast, ACE2 is a transcriptional activator of the CTS1 gene (which encodes chitinase), whereas SWI5 is not. An additional parallel between the SWI5/HO pathway and the ACE2/CTS1 pathway is that HO and CTS1 both are cell cycle regulated in the same way, and HO and CTS1 both require the SWI4 and SWI6 transcriptional activators. Overproduction of either SWI5 or ACE2 permits transcriptional activation of the target gene from the other pathway, suggesting that the DNA-binding proteins are capable of binding in vivo to promoters that they do not usually activate.

Formation of eIF4F is blocked by eIF4E-binding proteins such as 4E-BP1, which interacts with eIF4E via a motif in the center of its 118-residue sequence. 4E-BP1 plays key roles in cell proliferation, growth, and survival. Binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E is regulated by hierarchical multisite phosphorylation. Here we demonstrate that three different features in the C terminus of 4E-BP1 play distinct roles in regulating its phosphorylation and function. Firstly, we identify a new phosphorylation site in its C terminus (S101). A serine or glutamate at this position is required for efficient phosphorylation at Ser65. A second C-terminal site, S112, directly affects binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E without influencing phosphorylation of other sites. Thirdly, a conserved C-terminal motif influences phosphorylation of multiple residues, including rapamycin-insensitive sites. These relatively long-range effects are surprising given the reportedly unstructured nature of 4E-BP1 and may imply that phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and/or binding to eIF4E induces a more-ordered structure. 4E-BP2 and -3 lack phosphorylatable residues corresponding to both S101 and S112. However, in 4E-BP3, replacement of the alanine at the position corresponding to S112 by serine or glutamate did not confer the ability to be released from eIF4E in response to insulin."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event A20", "id": "1718107862117421024", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll-like receptor", "id": "4550191219973924948", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event A20", "id": "-8353527424843752739", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event tumor necrosis factor", "id": "-3788084471240556318", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF", "id": "7875410717374383251", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event A20", "id": "728269914864552470", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF", "id": "-8590203164302212826", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event A20", "id": "-4342218122359329276", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF receptor 1", "id": "-7905245362614917215", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event A20", "id": "5546001976167832670", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF", "id": "-6169287612137133732", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event A20", "id": "832651981422707488", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll-like receptor", "id": "-8563195980860095732", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event A20", "id": "-8719385258631319593", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "-480281178284113652", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR", "id": "-7065797659424045718", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ubiquitin", "id": "-743644691084356051", "answers": [{"text": 688, "answer_start": "removing"}, {"text": 14, "answer_start": "modifying"}, {"text": 896, "answer_start": "conjugation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 is required for termination of Toll-like receptor responses. \nA20 is a cytoplasmic protein required for the termination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced signals.

Furthermore, p50 binds and activates the CEBPA gene in myeloid cells. We now report that C/EBPalpha or C/EBPalpha leucine zipper AML mutants bind in vivo to the nfkb1 (p50) promoter and induce its expression even in the presence of cycloheximide. Induction of p50 by C/EBPalpha depends on 2 conserved kappaB sites in the nfkb1 promoter. C/EBPalpha did not induce p65 expression. Thus, C/EBPalpha and p50 reciprocally regulate each other's expression, establishing a positive feedback relationship. Although p50 homodimers inhibit transcription, C/EBPalpha and p50 synergistically activate antiapoptotic genes. ChIP analysis showed that C/EBPalpha diminishes the occupation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) or HDAC3 on the endogenous FLIP promoter but not in mice lacking p50.

This study hypothesised that Th17 signature cytokine IL-17 may target specialised human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLFs) for production of IL-23 p19, a key subunit of IL-23. Primary hPDLFs had steady expression of IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) mRNA and surface-bound protein. IL-17 was capable of stimulating the expression of IL-23 p19 mRNA and protein in cultured hPDLFs, which was attenuated by IL-17 or IL-17R neutralising antibodies. In accordance with the enhanced expression of IL-23 p19, IL-17 stimulation resulted in rapid activation of Akt, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in hPDLFs. Inhibitors of Akt, p38 MAPK, ERK 1/2, or NF-kappaB significantly suppressed, whereas blocking JNK and AP-1 substantially augmented IL-23 p19 production from IL-17-stimulated hPDLFs. Moreover, IL-17-initiated NF-kappaB activation was blocked by Akt, p38 MAPK, or ERK 1/2 inhibition, while AP-1 activity was specifically abrogated by JNK inhibition. Thus, these results provide evidence that hPDLFs are a target of Th17, and that IL-17 appears to up-regulate the expression of IL-23 p19 via a homeostatic mechanism involving Akt-, p38 MAPK-, and ERK 1/2-dependent NF-kappaB signalling versus the JNK/AP-1 pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that disruption of the interaction between IL-17 and IL-23 may be a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of periodontitis."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event ARHI", "id": "3272947921710536510", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ARHI", "id": "1451572774239276782", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-8568978219137311236", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "5970302380767319225", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 4", "id": "-6376608225124827066", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F2", "id": "7229947990964219252", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 6", "id": "2796229078911276152", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-2317501402350711484", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "1170543547716193330", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event histone deacetylase", "id": "-4764740063687172701", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ARHI", "id": "9010429982370774510", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event luciferase", "id": "-2954782175081490678", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-2146454725834140464", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-5909859743838120251", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 4", "id": "4977985314067614423", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event retinoblastoma protein", "id": "-3102046982012799229", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event pRB", "id": "-6251441374610319319", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-6039788091440689086", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F4", "id": "2601765991445614405", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-8995003049905423267", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 4", "id": "8641104504441295068", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HDAC", "id": "-604914609039550801", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ARHI", "id": "9203249396381449212", "answers": [{"text": 224, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 1707, "answer_start": "reduced"}, {"text": 1963, "answer_start": "effect"}, {"text": 1997, "answer_start": "repression"}, {"text": 19, "answer_start": "negatively regulate"}, {"text": 1419, "answer_start": "bind"}, {"text": 2035, "answer_start": "enhanced"}, {"text": 2196, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 148, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event histone H3", "id": "2008681120513686919", "answers": [{"text": 333, "answer_start": "methylation"}, {"text": 298, "answer_start": "acetylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event 4", "id": "-4919722041033364757", "answers": [{"text": 1419, "answer_start": "bind"}, {"text": 1707, "answer_start": "reduced"}, {"text": 1275, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-4655284896894637828", "answers": [{"text": 1275, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "7554793525782427010", "answers": [{"text": 1301, "answer_start": "increased"}, {"text": 1676, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event HDAC", "id": "-5008491129998290683", "answers": [{"text": 1566, "answer_start": "inhibitor"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event pRB", "id": "-2064259710895321842", "answers": [{"text": 2051, "answer_start": "coexpression"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "E2F-HDAC complexes negatively regulate the tumor suppressor gene ARHI in breast cancer. \nARHI is a maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene whose expression is markedly downregulated in breast cancer. Reactivation of ARHI expression in breast cancer cells is associated with increased histone H3 acetylation and decreased lysine 9 methylation of histone H3. An ARHI promoter segment that spanned bases -420 to +58 (designated the P2 region) exhibits significantly higher promoter activity in normal cells than in cancer cells. To better understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to this differential transcriptional activity, we sought to identify transcription factors that bind to the P2 region of the ARHI promoter and regulate its activity. Sequence analysis and oligonucleotide competition in electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified an A2 fragment containing an E2F-binding site. Using specific antibodies in supershift assays, we have shown that anti-E2F1 and 4 antibodies can supershift the A2-protein complexes, whereas anti-E2F2 and 6 antibodies cannot, demonstrating that the A2 fragment interacts with specific members of the E2F family proteins. When compared with normal breast epithelial cells, breast cancer cells have significantly elevated expression of E2F1, 4 and increased E2F DNA-binding activity. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both E2F1 and 4 bind to the ARHI promoter in breast cancer cells in vivo. This binding was reduced when the cells were treated with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor--trichostatin A (TSA). When SKBr3 cells were cotransfected with an ARHI/luciferase reporter and E2F-expression vectors, E2F1 and 4 reduced ARHI promoter activity 2-3-fold, and this reduction could be reversed by TSA treatment. The negative regulation by E2F-HDAC complexes could also be reduced by small interfering RNA of E2F1 and 4. While the retinoblastoma protein, pRB, alone had no effect on ARHI promoter activity, repression by E2F1, but not E2F4, was enhanced by the coexpression of pRB. Taken together, our results suggest that E2F1, 4 and their complexes with HDAC play an important role in downregulating the expression of the tumor suppressor gene ARHI in breast cancer cells."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Bir1p", "id": "-3153318521480513373", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Survivin", "id": "7947774357950232094", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event centromere binding factor 3", "id": "59708400389267212", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event CBF3", "id": "-5046506024219601487", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ndc10p", "id": "-1908049184128403920", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Sli15p", "id": "4410870690778091028", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event INCENP", "id": "6491158374131822517", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ipl1p", "id": "-8703729715943963713", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Aurora B", "id": "1700655252520515536", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Sli15p", "id": "-41642120595290854", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event BIR1", "id": "5737515611154338656", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Sli15p", "id": "-2260325081024868660", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event septin", "id": "-1585065988807524216", "answers": [{"text": 45, "answer_start": "regulates"}, {"text": 923, "answer_start": "regulating"}, {"text": 579, "answer_start": "regulation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Bir1p", "id": "-6579553231330639720", "answers": [{"text": 858, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 1032, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 747, "answer_start": "links"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "A Bir1p Sli15p kinetochore passenger complex regulates septin organization during anaphase. \nKinetochore-passenger complexes in metazoans have been proposed to coordinate the segregation of chromosomes in anaphase with the induction of cytokinesis.

The p53 signaling cascade is complex, and the mechanism by which p53 induces apoptosis is cell type-dependent. Using DNA microarray analysis, we have found a striking induction of the proapoptotic gene, SIVA. SIVA is a proapoptotic protein containing a death domain and interacts with members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. SIVA is induced following direct p53 gene delivery, treatment with a DNA-damaging agent camptothecin, and stroke injury in vivo. SIVA up-regulation is sufficient to initiate the apoptotic cascade in neurons. Through isolation and analysis of the SIVA promoter, we have identified response elements for both p53 and E2F1. Like p53, E2F1 is another tumor suppressor gene involved in the regulation of apoptosis, including neuronal injury models. We have identified E2F consensus sites in the promoter region, whereas p53 recognition sequences were found in intron1.

By expression cloning in COS-7 cells, we have isolated a cDNA from mouse 3T3-LI cells encoding this putative auxiliary molecule, which we term the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1R AcP). Sequence analysis of the cDNA predicts an open reading frame that encodes a 570-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of approximately 66 kDa. The IL-1R AcP is a member of the Ig superfamily by analysis of its putative extracellular domain and also bears limited homology throughout the protein to both Type I and Type II IL-1 receptors. Northern analysis reveals that murine IL-1R AcP mRNA is expressed in many tissues and appears to be regulated by IL-1. In mammalian cells expressing natural or recombinant Type I IL-1R and IL-1R AcP, the accessory protein forms a complex with the Type I IL-1R and either IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta but not IL-1ra.

Specifically, wortmannin (an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase [PI3]-kinases including DNA-PK) interferes with CpG-dependent cell activation, and DNA-PK knockout (KO) mice fail to respond to CpG stimulation. Current studies establish that wortmannin actually inhibits the uptake and colocalization of CpG DNA with toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 in endocytic vesicles, thereby preventing CpG-induced activation of the NF-kappaB signaling cascade.

Previously, we have shown that leukemic cells of most ATL patients express CCR4, a chemokine receptor known to be selectively expressed by T cell subsets such as Th2 cells, skin-homing memory/effector T cells, and regulatory T cells. Therefore, the expression of CCR4 suggests that ATL cells are mostly derived from one of these T cell subsets. We have also shown that Tax, the HTLV-1-encoded potent transcriptional activator, strongly induces the expression of CCL22, a CCR4 ligand, which promotes the cell-dependent transmission of HTLV-1 from HTLV-1-infected T cells to CCR4+ target T cells by inducing close cell-to-cell interactions.

Nuclear localisation of Ace2p is restricted to late M and early G phases of the mitotic cell cycle. We show here that this nuclear localisation is directly associated with regulation of CTS1 expression. Using a version of Ace2p tagged with a c-myc epitope, we show that the protein is excluded from the nucleus of cells during most phases of the mitotic cell cycle. A mutant derivative in which one threonine and two serine residues, which are candidate phosphorylation sites, were replaced by alanine (to mimic constitutive dephosphorylation) is localised in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. The mechanism of localisation of Ace2p therefore involves regulation of its phosphorylation state, and closely resembles that used by the homologous transcription factor Swi5p. The wild-type Ace2 protein associates with Cdc28p in vivo, suggesting this may be the kinase that mediates the phosphorylation event.

The last few years have seen a remarkable increase in our understanding of the canonical, growth factor-regulated pathway for mTOR activation, which is mediated by the class I PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases), PKB (protein kinase B), TSC1/2 (the tuberous sclerosis complex) and the small GTPase, Rheb. However, the nutrient-responsive input into mTOR is important in its own right and is also required for maximal activation of mTOR signalling by growth factors. Despite this, the details of the nutrient-responsive signalling pathway(s) controlling mTOR have remained elusive, although recent studies have suggested a role for the class III PI3K hVps34. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Findlay et al. demonstrate that the protein kinase MAP4K3 [mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase-3, a Ste20 family protein kinase also known as GLK (germinal centre-like kinase)] is a new component of the nutrient-responsive pathway. MAP4K3 activity is stimulated by administration of amino acids, but not growth factors, and this is insensitive to rapamycin, most likely placing MAP4K3 upstream of mTOR. Indeed, MAP4K3 is required for phosphorylation of known mTOR targets such as S6K1 (S6 kinase 1), and overexpression of MAP4K3 promotes the rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation of these same targets. Finally, knockdown of MAP4K3 levels causes a decrease in cell size. The results suggest that MAP4K3 is a new component in the nutrient-responsive pathway for mTOR activation and reveal a completely new function for MAP4K3 in promoting cell growth. Given that mTOR activity is frequently deregulated in cancer, there is much interest in new strategies for inhibition of this pathway. In this context, MAP4K3 looks like an attractive drug target since inhibitors of this enzyme should switch off mTOR, thereby inhibiting cell growth and proliferation, and promoting apoptosis."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Hsp70", "id": "-3343242201157583592", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Hsp70", "id": "5218622393031555371", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Hsp70", "id": "-4129191172548163712", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Hsp70", "id": "2341848090444752795", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AGC", "id": "-6985024948334840740", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Akt", "id": "8739402871642225047", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event protein kinase C", "id": "6699196799587296396", "answers": [{"text": 1801, "answer_start": "re-phosphorylation"}, {"text": 303, "answer_start": "activated"}, {"text": 681, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 922, "answer_start": "regulate"}, {"text": 1686, "answer_start": "binds"}, {"text": 1854, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 1088, "answer_start": "prolongs"}, {"text": 1181, "answer_start": "accumulation"}, {"text": 276, "answer_start": "prolonging"}, {"text": 993, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 752, "answer_start": "co-expression"}, {"text": 1214, "answer_start": "dephosphorylated"}, {"text": 1696, "answer_start": "dephosphorylated"}, {"text": 1764, "answer_start": "stabilizing"}, {"text": 367, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1921, "answer_start": "down-regulation"}, {"text": 1875, "answer_start": "re-phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1156, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 604, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}, {"text": 62, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Hsp70", "id": "4454615374671596485", "answers": [{"text": 681, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 499, "answer_start": "binds"}, {"text": 1686, "answer_start": "binds"}, {"text": 1361, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 752, "answer_start": "co-expression"}, {"text": 62, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1583, "answer_start": "bind"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event protein kinase C beta II", "id": "-8100459637030457400", "answers": [{"text": 499, "answer_start": "binds"}, {"text": 1384, "answer_start": "slows"}, {"text": 509, "answer_start": "unphosphorylated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event protein kinase A", "id": "1834181032605177380", "answers": [{"text": 1604, "answer_start": "unphosphorylated"}, {"text": 1583, "answer_start": "bind"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event protein kinase B", "id": "5443270096069575050", "answers": [{"text": 1604, "answer_start": "unphosphorylated"}, {"text": 1583, "answer_start": "bind"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The turn motif is a phosphorylation switch that regulates the binding of Hsp70 to protein kinase C. \nHeat shock proteins play central roles in ensuring the correct folding and maturation of cellular proteins. Here we show that the heat shock protein Hsp70 has a novel role in prolonging the lifetime of activated protein kinase C. We identified Hsp70 in a screen for binding partners for the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Hsp70 specifically binds the unphosphorylated turn motif (Thr(641) in protein kinase C beta II), one of three priming sites phosphorylated during the maturation of protein kinase C family members. The interaction of Hsp70 with protein kinase C can be abolished in vivo by co-expression of fusion proteins encoding the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C or the carboxyl terminus of Hsp70. Pulse-chase experiments reveal that Hsp70 does not regulate the maturation of protein kinase C: the rate of processing by phosphorylation is the same in the presence or absence of disrupting constructs. Rather, Hsp70 prolongs the lifetime of mature protein kinase C; disruption of the interaction promotes the accumulation of matured and then dephosphorylated protein kinase C in the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells. Furthermore, studies with K562 cells reveal that disruption of the interaction with Hsp70 slows the protein kinase C beta II-mediated recovery of cells from PMA-induced growth arrest. Last, we show that other members of the AGC superfamily (Akt/protein kinase B and protein kinase A) also bind Hsp70 via their unphosphorylated turn motifs. Our data are consistent with a model in which Hsp70 binds the dephosphorylated carboxyl terminus of mature protein kinase C, thus stabilizing the protein and allowing re-phosphorylation of the enzyme.

In several organisms homologs of the Wee1 kinase have been shown to be the major activity responsible for phosphorylating the Tyr15 inhibitory site. A membrane-bound kinase capable of phosphorylating residue Thr14, the Myt1 kinase, has been identified in the frog Xenopus laevis and more recently in human. In this study, we have examined the substrate specificity and cell cycle regulation of the human Myt1 kinase. We find that human Myt1 phosphorylates and inactivates Cdc2-containing cyclin complexes but not complexes containing Cdk2 or Cdk4. Analysis of endogenous Myt1 demonstrates that it remains membrane-bound throughout the cell cycle, but its kinase activity decreased during M phase arrest, when Myt1 became hyperphosphorylated. Further, Cdc2. cyclin B1 was capable of phosphorylating Myt1 in vitro, but this phosphorylation did not affect Myt1 kinase activity.

Genetic studies have shown the tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressors TSC1/2 and the REDD1 protein to be essential for hypoxia regulation of TORC1 activity in Drosophila and in mammalian cells. The molecular mechanism and physiologic significance of this effect of hypoxia remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia and REDD1 suppress mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1) activity by releasing TSC2 from its growth factor-induced association with inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins. Endogenous REDD1 is required for both dissociation of endogenous TSC2/14-3-3 and inhibition of mTORC1 in response to hypoxia. REDD1 mutants that fail to bind 14-3-3 are defective in eliciting TSC2/14-3-3 dissociation and mTORC1 inhibition, while TSC2 mutants that do not bind 14-3-3 are inactive in hypoxia signaling to mTORC1. In vitro, loss of REDD1 signaling promotes proliferation and anchorage-independent growth under hypoxia through mTORC1 dysregulation. In vivo, REDD1 loss elicits tumorigenesis in a mouse model, and down-regulation of REDD1 is observed in a subset of human cancers.

Accordingly, the major IE promoter (MIEP) enhancer, a critical control region for initiating lytic HCMV infection and reactivation from the latent state, contains one well-characterized AP-1 site and a second candidate interaction site. In this study we explored the role of these AP-1 elements in the context of the infection. We first show that the distal candidate AP-1 motif binds c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers (AP-1 complex) and confers c-Fos/c-Jun-mediated activity to a core promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that both AP-1 response elements are critical for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-enhanced MIEP activity in transient-transfection assays. In marked contrast to the results obtained with the isolated promoter, disruption of the AP-1 recognition sites of the MIEP in the context of the infectious HCMV genome has no significant influence on the expression of the MIE protein IE1 or viral replication in different cell types. Moreover, a chimeric murine CMV driven by the HCMV MIEP (hMCMV-ES) with the two AP-1 binding sites mutated is not compromised in virulence, is able to grow and disseminate to different organs of the newborn mice as efficiently as the parental virus, and is competent in reactivation. We show, however, that combined inactivation of the enhancer AP-1 and NF-kappaB recognition sites leads to an attenuation of the hMCMV-ES in the neonatal murine infection model, not observed when each single element is abolished. Altogether, these results underline the functional redundancy of the MIEP elements, highlighting the plasticity of this region, which probably evolved to ensure maximal transcriptional performance across many diverse environments."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Phosphoinositide 3-kinase", "id": "-7873382794552967987", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Transforming growth factor-beta", "id": "8597849533190361742", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TGF-beta", "id": "5473796477123021892", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Smads", "id": "-1498060721980011239", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cyclin-dependent kinase", "id": "-1955738242065428440", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cdk", "id": "9175935909561813349", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "-4812869215600236523", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event WAF1", "id": "-1441795091725206201", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PI3K", "id": "-8820488813177595539", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PI3K", "id": "7380374526415475051", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "-2319809815814298466", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event WAF1", "id": "-1493106150325840236", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Smad2/3", "id": "2061619017340341067", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PI3K", "id": "-6838210281095462736", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event WAF1", "id": "-6020243484262144235", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event WAF1", "id": "-6048587664189625039", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PI3K", "id": "-5229317375841396848", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event WAF1", "id": "-922328962839876591", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event WAF1", "id": "2142761357545480136", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21WAF1", "id": "-8540416971375171926", "answers": [{"text": 87, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Akt kinase", "id": "7759836218603298450", "answers": [{"text": 349, "answer_start": "increased"}, {"text": 589, "answer_start": "increased"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Phosphoinositide 3 kinase", "id": "-6764315506244383788", "answers": [{"text": 349, "answer_start": "increased"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PI3K", "id": "-5071164147235707921", "answers": [{"text": 589, "answer_start": "increased"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "-2809270493236648183", "answers": [{"text": 1199, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 893, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 816, "answer_start": "protein expression"}, {"text": 1221, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 798, "answer_start": "transcription"}, {"text": 1181, "answer_start": "transcription"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TGF-beta", "id": "-7188832621323829564", "answers": [{"text": 977, "answer_start": "induced"}, {"text": 1129, "answer_start": "induced"}, {"text": 952, "answer_start": "attenuating"}, {"text": 1103, "answer_start": "required"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Smad2/3", "id": "-4699316455085237194", "answers": [{"text": 1103, "answer_start": "required"}, {"text": 1129, "answer_start": "induced"}, {"text": 1015, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1048, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase is required for high glucose-induced hypertrophy and p21WAF1 expression in LLC-PK1 cells. \nTransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), Smads, and the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21(WAF1) are important in the pathogenesis of diabetic tubular hypertrophy.

Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy showed that Pdcd4 colocalizes with eIF4A in the cytoplasm. eIF4A is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase needed to unwind 5' mRNA secondary structure. Recombinant Pdcd4 specifically inhibited the helicase activity of eIF4A and eIF4F. In vivo translation assays showed that Pdcd4 inhibited cap-dependent but not internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation. In contrast, Pdcd4(D418A), a mutant inactivated for binding to eIF4A, failed to inhibit cap-dependent or IRES-dependent translation or AP-1 transactivation. Recombinant Pdcd4 prevented eIF4A from binding to the C-terminal region of eIF4G (amino acids 1040 to 1560) but not to the middle region of eIF4G(amino acids 635 to 1039). In addition, both Pdcd4 and Pdcd4(D418A) bound to the middle region of eIF4G.

In addition to regulating E2F-responsive genes in a reversible manner, pocket proteins contribute to silencing of such genes in cells that are undergoing senescence or differentiation.

Here we discuss the molecular mechanisms that direct cellular senescence and reveal its potential for tumor suppression."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event E7", "id": "8438671053394593948", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cdc25A", "id": "985873253686288624", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E7", "id": "-3113369023452293222", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-4946245240985435300", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-3145943174791641544", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F4", "id": "-3511435968633774367", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-7475083250257131477", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E7", "id": "-2307979096120917960", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cdc25A", "id": "-2580004104000095968", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Cdc25A", "id": "7023643153915536138", "answers": [{"text": 480, "answer_start": "regulation"}, {"text": 985, "answer_start": "increase"}, {"text": 814, "answer_start": "transactivated"}, {"text": 616, "answer_start": "derepression"}, {"text": 0, "answer_start": "Regulation"}, {"text": 897, "answer_start": "increased"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E7", "id": "-4828689041982232508", "answers": [{"text": 354, "answer_start": "interact"}, {"text": 946, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 1069, "answer_start": "target"}, {"text": 913, "answer_start": "expressing"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E6", "id": "1979149867916393184", "answers": [{"text": 354, "answer_start": "interact"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "3349531339219468555", "answers": [{"text": 385, "answer_start": "abrogate"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event pRB", "id": "-7828543572651815383", "answers": [{"text": 385, "answer_start": "abrogate"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Regulation of the Cdc25A gene by the human papillomavirus Type 16 E7 oncogene. \nCdc25A is a tyrosine phosphatase that is involved in the regulation of the G1/S phase transition by activating cyclin E/Cdk2 and cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes through removal of inhibitory phosphorylations. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) interact with and functionally abrogate the p53 and pRB proteins, respectively. In the present study we have investigated the regulation of the Cdc25A promoter during G1 and S-phases of the cell cycle and by the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein. Serum induction leads to a derepression of the Cdc25A promoter and can be mediated through two E2F binding sites, E2F-A and E2F-C. While E2F-A is by both E2F1 and E2F4, E2F-C is regulated only by E2F1. The Cdc25A promoter is transactivated by the E7 oncogene of HPV-16. Furthermore, Cdc25A levels are highly increased in E7-expressing cell lines. Inducible expression of E7 leads to an immediate increase in Cdc25A protein levels.

Induction of E2F1 is mediated by phosphorylation events that are dependent on DNA damage-responsive protein kinases, such as ATM. How ATM phosphorylation leads to E2F1 stabilization is unknown. We now show that 14-3-3 tau, a phosphoserine-binding protein, mediates E2F1 stabilization. 14-3-3 tau interacts with ATM-phosphorylated E2F1 during DNA damage and inhibits E2F1 ubiquitination. Depletion of 14-3-3 tau or E2F1, but not E2F2 or E2F3, blocks adriamycin-induced apoptosis. 14-3-3 tau is also required for expression and induction of E2F1 apoptotic targets, such as p73, Apaf-1, and caspases, during DNA damage.

Previously, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p50 Ser(337) is critical for DNA binding. Here, we report that p50 Ser(337) is constitutively phosphorylated by the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKAc) in three different cell types, which may account for the constant binding of p50/p50 to DNA in unstimulated cells. This was demonstrated first by showing that treatment of cells with PKAc-specific inhibitors blocked p50/p50 DNA binding. Second, phosphorylation of p50 by PKAc was prevented by substitution of Ser(337) to alanine. Third, both p50 and PKAc proteins as well as kinase activity that phosphorylates p50 were found to co-fractionate following gel filtration chromatography. Finally, PKAc and p50 were shown to be able to reciprocally co-immunoprecipitate one another, and their physical association was blocked by a PKA catalytic site inhibitory peptide. This indicates that phosphorylation of p50 Ser(337) involves direct contact with the PKAc catalytic center. In contrast to the dramatic elevation of nuclear p50/p65 heterodimers induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha, DNA binding of p50/p50 homodimers was not greatly altered. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time that there is a direct interaction between PKAc and p50 that accounts for constitutive phosphorylation of p50 Ser(337) and the existence of DNA bound p50/p50 in the nuclei of most resting cells. This mechanism of DNA binding by p50/p50 following phosphorylation of Ser(337) by PKAc may represent an important means for maintaining stable negative regulation of NF-kappaB gene expression in the absence of extracellular stimulation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event RTT109", "id": "4900968955261468866", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ASF1", "id": "4507917895188446723", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event H3", "id": "-8762669523157357507", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event histone acetyltransferase", "id": "-7732229936584199278", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HAT", "id": "2194040727076196223", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rtt109", "id": "6195523048756411192", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event histone", "id": "-2328163996727304246", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Asf1", "id": "1317187020302138566", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Asf1", "id": "2038431416607789715", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HAT", "id": "7122318111747487670", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Asf1", "id": "-7628518513920610080", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Asf1", "id": "-4710750260955976644", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Asf1", "id": "-8717686260491933421", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Asf1", "id": "7953694019524275749", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rtt109", "id": "5850660677766046273", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event SpRtt109", "id": "-3574885071730674452", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Asf1", "id": "7798709101248903571", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HAT", "id": "2338130413002474290", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Asf1", "id": "-1550333828930798567", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event histones H3", "id": "2449680610302195741", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event H4", "id": "6375784406266061504", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rtt109", "id": "1893850218976080948", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event histone H3", "id": "4603398999096669597", "answers": [{"text": 0, "answer_start": "Acetylation"}, {"text": 137, "answer_start": "acetylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Rtt109", "id": "883118423294059201", "answers": [{"text": 365, "answer_start": "lacking"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event H3", "id": "-8263430693387350711", "answers": [{"text": 1067, "answer_start": "dependent"}, {"text": 1223, "answer_start": "acetylation"}, {"text": 506, "answer_start": "acetylation"}, {"text": 461, "answer_start": "acetylation"}, {"text": 660, "answer_start": "complexed"}, {"text": 1157, "answer_start": "acetylation"}, {"text": 1334, "answer_start": "expressing"}, {"text": 1706, "answer_start": "acetylation"}, {"text": 764, "answer_start": "acetylation"}, {"text": 619, "answer_start": "acetylates"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event H4", "id": "4212177003136851063", "answers": [{"text": 660, "answer_start": "complexed"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event H3/H4", "id": "6838069532545291708", "answers": [{"text": 960, "answer_start": "bind"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Asf1", "id": "-1123316272699190753", "answers": [{"text": 1665, "answer_start": "role"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Acetylation of lysine 56 of histone H3 catalyzed by RTT109 and regulated by ASF1 is required for replisome integrity. \nIn budding yeast, acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3-K56) is catalyzed by the Rtt109-Vps75 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, with Rtt109 being the catalytic subunit, and histone chaperone Asf1 is required for this modification. Cells lacking Rtt109 are susceptible to perturbations in DNA replication. However, how Asf1 regulates acetylation of H3-K56 and how loss of H3-K56 acetylation affects DNA replication are unclear. We show that at low concentrations the Rtt109-Vps75 HAT complex acetylates H3-K56 in vitro when H3/H4 is complexed with Asf1, but not H3/H4 tetramers, recapitulating the in vivo requirement of Asf1 for H3-K56 acetylation using recombinant proteins. Moreover, the Rtt109-Vps75 complex interacts with Asf1-H3/H4 but not Asf1. In vivo, the Rtt109-Asf1 interaction is also dependent on the ability of Asf1 to bind H3/H4. Furthermore, the Rtt109 homolog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SpRtt109) also displayed an Asf1-dependent H3-K56 HAT activity in vitro. These results indicate that Asf1 regulates H3-K56 acetylation by presenting histones H3 and H4 to Rtt109-Vps575 for acetylation, and this mechanism is likely to be conserved. Finally, we have shown that cells lacking Rtt109 or expressing H3-K56 mutants exhibited significant reduction in the association of three proteins with stalled DNA replication forks and hyper-recombination of replication forks stalled at replication fork barriers of the ribosomal DNA locus compared with wild-type cells.

The transcription potential of ATF2 is enhanced markedly by NH2-terminal phosphorylation by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and mediates stress responses including DNA-damaging events. We have observed that four DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin, actinomycin D, MMS, and etoposide), but not the cisplatin isomer, transplatin, which does not readily damage DNA, strongly activate JNK, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and strongly increase phosphorylation and ATF2-dependent transcriptional activity. Selective inhibition studies with PD98059, SB202190, SP600125, and the dominant negative JNK indicate that activation of JNK but not p38 kinase or ERK kinase is required for the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of ATF2. Stable expression of ATF2 in human breast carcinoma BT474 cells increases transcriptional activity and confers resistance to the four DNA-damaging agents, but not to transplatin. Conversely, stable expression of a dominant negative ATF2 (dnATF2) quantitatively blocks phosphorylation of endogenous ATF2 leading to a marked decrease in transcriptional activity by endogenous ATF2 and a markedly increased sensitivity to the four agents as judged by decreased cell viability. Similarly, application of SB202190 at 50 micro m or SP600125 inhibited JNK activity, blocked transactivation, and sensitized parental cells to the four DNA-damaging drugs. Moreover, the wild type ATF2-expressing clones exhibited rapid DNA repair after treatment with the four DNA-damaging agents but not transplatin. Conversely, expression of dnATF2 quantitatively blocks DNA repair. These results indicate that JNK-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2 plays an important role in the drug resistance phenotype likely by mediating enhanced DNA repair by a p53-independent mechanism.

Activation requires phosphorylation of threonine 210 by an upstream kinase as well as a distinct step mediated by the Snf4 subunit. \nThe yeast Snf1 kinase and its metazoan orthologues, the AMP-activated protein kinases, are activated in response to nutrient limitation. Activation requires the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the activation loop of the catalytic subunit. A phosphopeptide antibody was generated that specifically recognizes Snf1 protein that is phosphorylated in its activation loop on threonine 210. Using this reagent, we show that phosphorylation of threonine 210 correlates with Snf1 activity, since it is detected in cells subjected to glucose limitation but not in cells grown in abundant glucose. A Snf1 mutant completely lacking kinase activity was phosphorylated normally on threonine 210 in glucose-starved cells, eliminating the possibility that the threonine 210 modification is due to an autophosphorylation event. Cells lacking the Reg1 protein, a regulatory subunit for the Glc7 phosphatase, showed constitutive phosphorylation of Snf1 threonine 210. Exposure of cells to high concentrations of sodium chloride also induced phosphorylation of Snf1. Interestingly, Mig1, a downstream target of Snf1 kinase, is phosphorylated in glucose-stressed but not sodium-stressed cells. Finally, cells lacking the gamma subunit of the Snf1 kinase complex encoded by the SNF4 gene exhibited normal regulation of threonine 210 phosphorylation in response to glucose limitation but are unable to phosphorylate Mig1 efficiently.

Human cells with high proliferative potential, such as tumor cells or stem cells, exhibit telomerase activity, whereas most normal human somatic cells do not. Telomerase activity is tightly regulated by the expression of its catalytic subunit human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Through an expression cloning approach, we identified E2F-1 as a repressor of the hTERT gene in human tumor cells. Ectopic expression of E2F-1 repressed hTERT promoter activity by inhibiting Sp1 activation of the hTERT promoter. In contrast to the repressor function of E2F-1 in human tumor cells, we demonstrated that E2F-1 is an activator of the hTERT gene in normal human somatic cells. Ectopically expressed E2F-1 activated the hTERT promoter through a noncanonical DNA binding site. E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 (but not E2F-4 and E2F-5) repressed hTERT promoter activity in human tumor cells, whereas they activated it in normal somatic cells.

SWI4 transcription itself is cell cycle regulated, and this periodicity is crucial for the normal cell cycle regulation of HO and at least two of the G1 cyclins. Since the regulation of SWI4 is required for normal cell cycle progression, we have characterized cis- and trans-acting regulators of SWI4 transcription. Deletion analysis of the SWI4 promoter has defined a 140-bp region which is absolutely required for transcription and can function as a cell cycle-regulated upstream activating sequence (UAS). The SWI4 UAS contains three potential MluI cell cycle boxes (MCBs), which are known cell cycle-regulated promoter elements. Deletion of all three MCBs in the SWI4 UAS decreases the level of SWI4 mRNA 10-fold in asynchronous cultures but does not abolish periodicity. These data suggest that MCBs are involved in SWI4 UAS activity, but at least one other periodically regulated element must be present. Since SWI6 is known to bind to MCBs and regulate their activity, the role of SWI6 in SWI4 expression was analyzed. Although the MCBs cannot account for the full cell cycle regulation of SWI4, mutations in SWI6 eliminate the normal periodicity of SWI4 transcription. This suggests that the novel cell cycle-regulated element within the SWI4 promoter is also SWI6 dependent. The constitutive transcription of SWI4 in SWI6 mutant cells occurs at an intermediate level, which indicates that SWI6 is required for the full activation and repression of SWI4 transcription through the cell cycle. It also suggests that there is another pathway which can activate SWI4 transcription in the absence of SWI6. The second activator may also target MCB elements, since SWI4 transcription drops dramatically when they are deleted."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Myt1", "id": "5444566190516919909", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Myt1", "id": "-6444889673080184300", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Myt1", "id": "7294578099679973153", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Myt1", "id": "-7757521306568765746", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Myt1", "id": "-2571082800783298181", "answers": [{"text": 501, "answer_start": "kinase-active"}, {"text": 476, "answer_start": "overproduction"}, {"text": 518, "answer_start": "kinase-inactive"}, {"text": 1213, "answer_start": "overproduction"}, {"text": 912, "answer_start": "overproducing"}, {"text": 0, "answer_start": "Overproduction"}, {"text": 1172, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 318, "answer_start": "localizes"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Cdc2", "id": "4929858766073958840", "answers": [{"text": 1172, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 230, "answer_start": "phosphorylating"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event cyclin B1", "id": "-7348571445216651971", "answers": [{"text": 580, "answer_start": "shuttling"}, {"text": 995, "answer_start": "trafficking"}, {"text": 804, "answer_start": "bound"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Overproduction of human Myt1 kinase induces a G2 cell cycle delay by interfering with the intracellular trafficking of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes. \nThe Myt1 protein kinase functions to negatively regulate Cdc2-cyclin B complexes by phosphorylating Cdc2 on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15. Throughout interphase, human Myt1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, whereas Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here we report that overproduction of either kinase-active or kinase-inactive forms of Myt1 blocked the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of cyclin B1 and caused cells to delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The COOH-terminal 63 amino acids of Myt1 were identified as a Cdc2-cyclin B1 interaction domain.

In addition, cells overproducing mutant forms of Myt1 lacking the interaction domain exhibited normal trafficking of cyclin B1 and unperturbed cell cycle progression.

Herein we apply homology-search methods to identify novel sequences belonging to a second SSAT, SSAT-2, with a chromosomal location at 17p13.1, which is distinct from SSAT-1 at Xp22. Human SSAT-2 cDNA derived from small-cell lung carcinoma was deduced to encode a 170-amino-acid protein having 46% sequence identity and 64% sequence similarity with SSAT-1. When transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells, SSAT-1 decreased spermidine and spermine pools by approximately 30%, while, at the same time, significantly increasing putrescine, N (1)-acetylspermidine, N (1)-acetylspermine and N (1), N (12)-diacetylspermine pools. By contrast, transfected SSAT-2 had no effect on intracellular polyamine or acetylated polyamine pools. When enzyme activity was assayed on enzyme extracts from transfected cells, both SSAT-1 and SSAT-2 demonstrated much higher acetylating activity than vector-transfected cells. The data suggest that, in intact cells, SSAT-2 may be compartmentalized or it may be inefficient at low intracellular polyamine concentrations. By substituting candidate substrates in the enzyme assay, we determined that SSAT-1 shows the substrate preference norspermidine=spermidine>spermine> N (1)-acetylspermine>putrescine, whereas SSAT-2 shows the preference norspermidine>spermidine=spermine> N (1)-acetylspermine=putrescine. Analysis of mRNA levels in cell lines and ESTs (expressed sequence tags) from various tissues by digiNorthern (a web-based tool for virtually displaying expression profiles of query genes based on EST sequences) indicated that SSAT-1 tends to be more widely and highly expressed than SSAT-2. While SSAT-1 mRNA was inducible by polyamine analogues in a variety of cell lines, SSAT-2 was not.

The Yersinia enterocolitica outer protein P (YopP) inhibits activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B in macrophages, which suppresses NF-kappa B-dependent antiapoptotic activities. The simultaneous initiation of proapoptotic signaling by yersiniae infection or LPS treatment results in macrophage apoptosis. In this study, we used YopP as a tool to dissect survival- and death-inducing pathways in bacteria-faced macrophages. We cotransfected J774A.1 macrophages with expression plasmids for YopP and dominant-negative mutants of signal transmitters of the NF-kappa B cascade downstream from the LPS receptor complex. Dominant-negative myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) or IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) 2 diminished LPS-induced apoptosis in YopP-transfected macrophages, suggesting implication of MyD88 and IRAK2 in signaling cell death. In contrast, dominant-negative IRAK1 and TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) did not provide protection, but augmented LPS-mediated apoptosis in the absence of YopP, which indicates roles of IRAK1 and TRAF6 in the antiapoptotic signal relay of the NF-kappa B cascade. The distinct functions of IRAK members in macrophage survival were reflected by opposing effects of dominant-negative IRAK1 and IRAK2 on Y. enterocolitica-mediated apoptosis. Yersiniae- and LPS-dependent cell death were substantially attenuated by a specific caspase-8 inhibitory peptide or by dominant negative Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD). This suggests, that Yersinia-induced apoptosis involves a proapoptotic signal relay through MyD88 and IRAK2, which potentially targets the Fas-associated death domain protein/caspase-8 apoptotic pathway, whereas IRAK1 and TRAF6 counteract the bacteria-induced cytotoxic response by signaling macrophage survival."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Tir", "id": "1778484814951054102", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NleC", "id": "-9129639886407976873", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NleH", "id": "7634118816472087938", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NleB1", "id": "6879543769189608971", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NleE1", "id": "3564073722688485838", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Translocated-intimin receptor", "id": "-6594404416485229474", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Tir", "id": "-3949857145119965204", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF", "id": "3936036220272887088", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Tir", "id": "-2164649977396726675", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF", "id": "-3297158578886758649", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Tir", "id": "-1462990802661434608", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NleC", "id": "1705757395885398612", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NleH", "id": "-3475634297702302326", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NleB1", "id": "-3783882097917177300", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NleE1", "id": "4193204655472770756", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Tir", "id": "-3966811082605168291", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNFalpha receptor-associated factors", "id": "-1272022934371519277", "answers": [{"text": 80, "answer_start": "targeting"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Tir", "id": "1660162002079576246", "answers": [{"text": 1382, "answer_start": "linked"}, {"text": 1069, "answer_start": "interaction"}, {"text": 1413, "answer_start": "suppressed"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TNFalpha receptor-associated factor", "id": "2418267580489988517", "answers": [{"text": 1202, "answer_start": "degradation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) Tir effector inhibits NF-kappaB activity by targeting TNFalpha receptor-associated factors. \nEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) disease depends on the transfer of effector proteins into epithelia lining the human small intestine.

Our previous work implied that non-LEE-encoded (Nle) effectors possess functions that inhibit epithelial anti-microbial and inflammation-inducing responses by blocking NF-kappaB transcription factor activity. Indeed, screens by us and others have identified novel inhibitory mechanisms for NleC and NleH, with key co-operative functions for NleB1 and NleE1. Here, we demonstrate that the LEE-encoded Translocated-intimin receptor (Tir) effector has a potent and specific ability to inhibit NF-kappaB activation. Indeed, biochemical, imaging and immunoprecipitation studies reveal a novel inhibitory mechanism whereby Tir interaction with cytoplasm-located TNFalpha receptor-associated factor (TRAF) adaptor proteins induces their proteasomal-independent degradation. Infection studies support this Tir-TRAF relationship but reveal that Tir, like NleC and NleH, has a non-essential contribution in EPEC's NF-kappaB inhibitory capacity linked to Tir's activity being suppressed by undefined EPEC factors. Infections in a disease-relevant intestinal model confirm key NF-kappaB inhibitory roles for the NleB1/NleE1 effectors, with other studies providing insights on host targets.

SNP309 did not show any association with primary susceptibility to childhood ALL, even after stratification by sex. However, females with SNP309 minor allele had earlier onset of childhood ALL (median age at diagnosis was 36 months in females, but 60 months in males; P=0.002).

Cyclin A is degraded during metaphase and cyclin B1 is precipitously destroyed at the metaphase----anaphase transition.

METHODS: Cell morphology was assayed by Wright and fluorescence stain, PML mRNA expression by RT-PCR, and PML protein localization by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: (1) Differentiation was observed by morphology in NB4 and HL-60 cells after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) while K562 cells did not show. Apoptosis was found in each cell line after treatment with quercetin. (2) After treatment with ATRA, the fusion protein disappeared and PML protein resumed in NB4 cells, while in HL-60 and K562 cells there was no difference from control cells. After treatment with quercetin, the fusion protein disappeared in NB4 cells, then degraded, and so did in HL-60 cells and K562 cells.

These effects of tGPI-mucins may be important in the ensuing immune response to T. cruzi. Here, we have sought evidence for a role of tGPI-mucins in mediating leukocyte recruitment in vivo. tGPI-mucins are highly effective in promoting cell recruitment in the pleural cavity of mice primed with IFN-gamma-inducing agents but not in naive mice. Maximal recruitment was observed at a dose between 250 and 1250 ng tGPI-mucins. There was a significant elevation in the levels of MCP-1 in the pleural cavity of primed animals injected with tGPI-mucins, and in vivo neutralization of MCP-1 abolished leukocyte recruitment. Pretreatment with anti-MIP-1alpha or anti-RANTES had no effect on the recruitment induced by tGPI-mucins. MCP-1 immunoreactivity was detected in pleural macrophages, and macrophages produced MCP-1 in vitro, especially after priming with IFN-gamma. Finally, tGPI-mucins induced significant leukocyte recruitment in primed C3H/HeJ but not in TLR2-deficient mice.

Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) are restricted to Old World monkeys, apes, and humans and have previously been shown to impair inflammasome assembly and/or NF-kappaB p65 transcriptional activity in transfected epithelial cells. However, the biological role of POP2 and the molecular basis for its observed functions are not well understood. In this report we demonstrate that POP2 regulates TNFalpha and IL-1beta responses in human monocytic THP-1 cells and in stable transfectants of mouse J774A.1 macrophages. Deletion analysis of POP2 revealed that the first alpha-helix (residues 1-19) is necessary and sufficient for both inflammasome and NF-kappaB inhibitory functions. Further, key acidic residues Glu(6), Asp(8), and Glu(16), believed critical for Pyrin/Pyrin domain interaction, are important for inflammasome inhibition. Moreover, these mutations did not reduce the effect of POP2 upon NF-kappaB, indicating that the inflammasome and NF-kappaB inhibitory properties of POP2 can be uncoupled mechanistically. Collectively, these data demonstrate that POP2 acts as a regulator of inflammatory signals and exerts its two known functions through distinct modalities employed by its first alpha-helix."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event IKK beta", "id": "2419316425031124476", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "1937370730563845478", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNFalpha", "id": "1724492324526157807", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "8097090743902022664", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNFalpha", "id": "-4049112550224453916", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IKKbeta", "id": "-3855916153500053926", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mTOR", "id": "3701624892740844767", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TSC1", "id": "558257367487131506", "answers": [{"text": 9, "answer_start": "suppression"}, {"text": 684, "answer_start": "suppression"}, {"text": 582, "answer_start": "phosphorylates"}, {"text": 865, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 563, "answer_start": "interacts"}, {"text": 637, "answer_start": "suppression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event IKKbeta", "id": "5352395888577130300", "answers": [{"text": 563, "answer_start": "interacts"}, {"text": 816, "answer_start": "activated"}, {"text": 802, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event VEGF", "id": "484598697047539261", "answers": [{"text": 890, "answer_start": "production"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "IKK beta suppression of TSC1 links inflammation and tumor angiogenesis via the mTOR pathway. \nTNFalpha has recently emerged as a regulator linking inflammation to cancer pathogenesis, but the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this link remain to be elucidated.

Here we show that IKKbeta, a major downstream kinase in the TNFalpha signaling pathway, physically interacts with and phosphorylates TSC1 at Ser487 and Ser511, resulting in suppression of TSC1. The IKKbeta-mediated TSC1 suppression activates the mTOR pathway, enhances angiogenesis, and results in tumor development. We further find that expression of activated IKKbeta is associated with TSC1 Ser511 phosphorylation and VEGF production in multiple tumor types and correlates with poor clinical outcome of breast cancer patients.

The message conveyed by RA is likely modulated by the concentration of the ligand available for binding to the receptors. Following the uptake of plasma retinol, epidermal keratinocytes synthesize retinoic acid via two sequential reactions with retinaldehyde as an intermediate. Several retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) enzymes, members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) gene superfamily, catalyze the first and rate-limiting step that generates retinaldehyde from retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein (holo-CRBP). However, little is known about these enzymes and their genes in the epidermal cells. Our work describes the first member of the RDH family found in epidermis. We show that this gene is expressed predominantly in the differentiating spinous layers and that it is under positive, feed-forward regulation by retinoic acid.

NFATs contain two CN binding motifs: PxIxIT and CnBP-B/CNBR2 (which we call LxVP). Here we carry out a detailed comparative analysis of the CN binding activity displayed by the PxIxIT and LxVP sites from different NFATs. Dose-response CN binding experiments with GST fusion proteins of NFATc1 and NFATc2 showed that NFATc1 binds CN in vitro more efficiently than does NFATc2. This difference in binding appears to be caused by the different CN binding potencies of the corresponding LxVP sites; thus while the LxVPc2 peptide fused to GST did not bind CN, GST-LxVPc1 bound it more efficiently than did GST-PxIxITc1 or GST-PxIxITc2. Furthermore, an NFATc2 chimera protein containing the LxVP motif from NFATc1 interacted with CN much more potently than did wild-type NFATc2. Free peptides spanning the LxVP motifs from NFATc1, c3 or c4 displaced CN from GST-NFATc1 and GST-NFATc2 more efficiently than any PxIxIT peptide. PxIxITc2 and LxVPc1 peptides were each able to cross-compete GST-LxVPc1-CN and GST-PxIxITc2-CN binding. In contrast with PxIxITc2, the LxVP peptide not only blocked CN-NFAT binding but also inhibited CN phosphatase activity in vitro. Furthermore, exogenous LxVPc1 blocked NFATc2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in vivo. These results suggest a model in which the different CN binding characteristics of the PxIxIT and LxVP sites enable different NFAT members to influence each others activities in cells where they are co-expressed."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event NFATc1", "id": "-7175289212232082523", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ATX", "id": "2345348867773928753", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HIF-1alpha", "id": "-5680062157056564818", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AhR", "id": "-51011201205090029", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event nuclear factor of activated T-cells", "id": "-8064935535565138495", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NFAT", "id": "2130051478160889132", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event AhR", "id": "-3858274842565717164", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HIF-1alpha", "id": "4557580877918333269", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event NFAT", "id": "3845009395671366529", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ATX", "id": "-7714458192139184528", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ATX", "id": "8463888395471940627", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ATX", "id": "2538180852561587381", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ATX", "id": "3875459399706965216", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha", "id": "-6056636277357562094", "answers": [{"text": 262, "answer_start": "activates"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event aryl hydrocarbon receptor", "id": "-1474386514857964089", "answers": [{"text": 262, "answer_start": "activates"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event AhR", "id": "-7412724813381725735", "answers": [{"text": 735, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event HIF-1alpha", "id": "-8372118383513538864", "answers": [{"text": 774, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event NFATc1", "id": "398121779711705455", "answers": [{"text": 1474, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 806, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event NFAT", "id": "8409306049185740571", "answers": [{"text": 900, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event autotaxin", "id": "1330928559679005242", "answers": [{"text": 1044, "answer_start": "increased"}, {"text": 980, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event ATX", "id": "5037898346510118033", "answers": [{"text": 1111, "answer_start": "hydrolysis"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "TCDD induces cell migration via NFATc1/ATX-signaling in MCF-7 cells. \nBreast cancer is characterized, among others, by the concurrence of lipophilic xenobiotica such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD) with hypoxic tissue conditions. This condition activates the transcription factors hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) that are known to promote tumor progression. An interrelation between these transcription factors and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) was implied by gene array analysis. In the present study, the interplay of the three transcription factors was studied and correlated with the migration of MCF-7 cells in response to TCDD and/or hypoxia. An AhR-activation by 10nM TCDD and HIF-1alpha activation by 5% oxygen induced activation of NFATc1. The effects were inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA), suggesting that the activation of NFAT by AhR or HIF-1alpha signaling is calcineurin-dependent. The expression/activity of the NFAT target gene autotaxin (ATX) was increased. ATX is known to stimulate migration of tumor cells. The hydrolysis product of ATX, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), increased the migration of MCF-7 cells under normoxia but not under hypoxia. This effect correlated with increased migration observed after TCDD treatment. Hypoxia did not promote migration of MCF-7 cells, suggesting that ATX down-stream signaling was inhibited by hypoxia. In conclusion, the TCDD-mediated activation of NFATc1 is suggested to promote cell migration via ATX/LPA-signaling."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event tubulin", "id": "6477049478277721892", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event actin", "id": "5114375776939413680", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event t-complex polypeptide 1", "id": "-4773789715226541050", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TCP1", "id": "-4644011063835979249", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TCP1", "id": "-4972538417866444664", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event anti-TCP1 antibody", "id": "5886093135801714865", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event actin", "id": "-3008244507983985756", "answers": [{"text": 850, "answer_start": "folding"}, {"text": 273, "answer_start": "biogenesis"}, {"text": 432, "answer_start": "synthesized"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event tubulin", "id": "-5007596370034276850", "answers": [{"text": 645, "answer_start": "forming heterodimers"}, {"text": 273, "answer_start": "biogenesis"}, {"text": 850, "answer_start": "folding"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event beta-tubulin", "id": "5450792802336694544", "answers": [{"text": 432, "answer_start": "synthesized"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event alpha-tubulin", "id": "2354854919664280752", "answers": [{"text": 432, "answer_start": "synthesized"}, {"text": 500, "answer_start": "enter a large molecular mass complex"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The t-complex polypeptide 1 complex is a chaperonin for tubulin and actin in vivo. \nA role in folding newly translated cytoskeletal proteins in the cytosol of eukaryotes has been proposed for t-complex polypeptide 1 (TCP1).

To test this, we 1) determined the acute vasoactive effects of MA (1-1,000 micromol/l) in uncontracted and norepinephrine (NE; 1 micromol/l)-precontracted human blood vessels used for coronary artery bypass grafts [left internal mammary artery (LIMA), radial artery (RA), and right saphenous vein (RSV)]; 2) tested whether MA effects in LIMA and RSV were dependent on SSAO activity using the SSAO inhibitor semicarbazide (1 mmol/l, 15 min); 3) determined the effects of MA metabolites formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide in LIMA and RSV; 4) tested whether the MA response was nitric oxide, prostaglandin, or hyperpolarization dependent; 5) measured the LIMA and RSV cGMP levels after MA exposure; and 6) quantified SSAO activity in LIMA, RA, and RSV. In NE-precontracted vessels, MA stimulated a biphasic response in RA and RSV (rapid contraction followed by prolonged relaxation) and dominant relaxation in LIMA (mean +/- SE, %relaxation: 55.4 +/- 3.9, n = 30).

Additional elements provide both positive (CCAAT and Myb) and negative (CHR) control. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identify multiple interactions of E2F proteins that include those previously shown to activate and repress transcription. We find that E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 bind to the positive-acting E2F site in the cdc2 promoter, whereas E2F4 binds to the negative-acting site. We also find that binding of an activator E2F is dependent on an adjacent CCAAT site that is bound by the NF-Y transcription factor and binding of a repressor E2F is dependent on an adjacent CHR element, suggesting a role for cooperative interactions in determining both activation and repression. Finally, the kinetics of B-Myb interaction with the G2-regulated promoters coincides with the activation of the genes, and RNAi-mediated reduction of B-Myb inhibits expression of cyclin B1 and cdc2. The ability of B-Myb to interact with the cdc2 promoter is dependent on an intact E2F binding site.

Acetylation of E2F-1 can be reversed by histone deacetylase-1, indicating that reversible acetylation is a mechanism for regulation also of non-histone proteins."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event cdk", "id": "-5367031526302131589", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-7520858931384068230", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cdk2", "id": "8194948139669117977", "answers": [{"text": 691, "answer_start": "increased"}, {"text": 11, "answer_start": "induces"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event histone H2B", "id": "882826263181458371", "answers": [{"text": 933, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1126, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 55, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-7873648932560744392", "answers": [{"text": 1065, "answer_start": "induction"}, {"text": 512, "answer_start": "induction"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "9171581152945949356", "answers": [{"text": 543, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event cyclin E", "id": "-4682189183234768281", "answers": [{"text": 691, "answer_start": "increased"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event caspase-3", "id": "8475386988271021561", "answers": [{"text": 1153, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 1377, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event histone", "id": "3048596257956145997", "answers": [{"text": 1389, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "DNA damage induces cdk2 protein levels and histone H2B phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. \nDNA damage and activation of the cell cycle have been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To better understand the role of cell cycle proteins in DNA-damage induced neuronal cell death, we examined various cell cycle proteins during camptothecin-induced death of human neuroblastoma cells. We report a rapid induction of p53 and increased expression of p21, concurrent with reduced levels of many cell cycle proteins that regulate G1 to S phase cell cycle progression. However, we found increased levels of cdk2 and cyclin E, and formation of a cyclin E-cdk2-p21 protein complex. DNA damage failed to induce activation and progression of the cell cycle. Finally, camptothecin-induced neuronal cell death occurred concurrent with phosphorylation of histone H2B. Pretreatment of cells with cdk inhibitor olomoucine impeded cdk2-cyclin E accumulation, but not the induction of p53. Olomucine concurrently delayed histone H2B phosphorylation, caspase-3 activation and cell death. These findings suggest that DNA-damage of differentiated neuroblastoma cells induces a rapid p53-mediated inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of cdk2-cyclin E, followed by caspase-3 activation, phosphorylation of histone and cell death."}]}]}
