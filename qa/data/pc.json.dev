These functions correlate with its ability to localize to and disrupt centromeres and specific subnuclear structures known as ND10, PML nuclear bodies, or promyelocytic oncogenic domains. Since the natural site of herpesvirus latency is in neurons, we investigated the status of ND10 and centromeres in uninfected and infected human cells with neuronal characteristics. We found that NT2 cells, a neuronally committed human teratocarcinoma cell line, have abnormal ND10 characterized by low expression of the major ND10 component PML and no detectable expression of another major ND10 antigen, Sp100. In addition, PML is less extensively modified by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 in NT2 cells compared to fibroblasts. After treatment with retinoic acid, NT2 cells differentiate into neuron-like hNT cells which express very high levels of both PML and Sp100. Infection of both NT2 and hNT cells by HSV-1 was poor compared to human fibroblasts, and after low-multiplicity infection yields of virus were reduced by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. ICP0-deficient mutants were also disabled in the neuron-related cell lines, and cells quiescently infected with an ICP0-null virus could be established. These results correlated with less-efficient disruption of ND10 and centromeres induced by ICP0 in NT2 and hNT cells. Furthermore, the ability of ICP0 to activate gene expression in transfection assays in NT2 cells was poor compared to Vero cells. These results suggest that a contributory factor in the reduced HSV-1 replication in the neuron-related cells is inefficient ICP0 function; it is possible that this is pertinent to the establishment of latent infection in neurons in vivo."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event APC", "id": "8878098002188392403", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Axin", "id": "-2445427245634406841", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-5337881999223678709", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "7019641666760529173", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-60405610274262152", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "2863731862291265893", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "8841121203255724076", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "3888419677956652714", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "371193741407908688", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event axin", "id": "5551009273253243837", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event APC", "id": "-5595044101731242852", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "4620545717174278231", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event APC", "id": "-2716593376157282351", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "-6383927308767259470", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event beta-catenin", "id": "-4136510130481877835", "answers": [{"text": 1251, "answer_start": "turnover"}, {"text": 352, "answer_start": "degradation"}, {"text": 214, "answer_start": "stabilization"}, {"text": 1771, "answer_start": "accumulation"}, {"text": 623, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event axin", "id": "-7533827329394512843", "answers": [{"text": 1251, "answer_start": "turnover"}, {"text": 1677, "answer_start": "degradation"}, {"text": 1580, "answer_start": "degradation"}, {"text": 375, "answer_start": "degraded"}, {"text": 623, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event GSK3beta", "id": "7461985966590710123", "answers": [{"text": 623, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Frizzled", "id": "-4520447744610686425", "answers": [{"text": 623, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Wnt", "id": "1857338209505069165", "answers": [{"text": 623, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Dishevelled", "id": "9208274993730168497", "answers": [{"text": 623, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TCF", "id": "3581187835372496748", "answers": [{"text": 623, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event APC", "id": "-61032055321885332", "answers": [{"text": 1803, "answer_start": "decreased"}, {"text": 623, "answer_start": "interactions"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The roles of APC and Axin derived from experimental and theoretical analysis of the Wnt pathway. \nWnt signaling plays an important role in both oncogenesis and development. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in stabilization of the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin. Recent studies have demonstrated that axin, which coordinates beta-catenin degradation, is itself degraded. Although the key molecules required for transducing a Wnt signal have been identified, a quantitative understanding of this pathway has been lacking. We have developed a mathematical model for the canonical Wnt pathway that describes the interactions among the core components: Wnt, Frizzled, Dishevelled, GSK3beta, APC, axin, beta-catenin, and TCF. Using a system of differential equations, the model incorporates the kinetics of protein-protein interactions, protein synthesis/degradation, and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. We initially defined a reference state of kinetic, thermodynamic, and flux data from experiments using Xenopus extracts. Predictions based on the analysis of the reference state were used iteratively to develop a more refined model from which we analyzed the effects of prolonged and transient Wnt stimulation on beta-catenin and axin turnover. We predict several unusual features of the Wnt pathway, some of which we tested experimentally. An insight from our model, which we confirmed experimentally, is that the two scaffold proteins axin and APC promote the formation of degradation complexes in very different ways. We can also explain the importance of axin degradation in amplifying and sharpening the Wnt signal, and we show that the dependence of axin degradation on APC is an essential part of an unappreciated regulatory loop that prevents the accumulation of beta-catenin at decreased APC concentrations. By applying control analysis to our mathematical model, we demonstrate the modular design, sensitivity, and robustness of the Wnt pathway and derive an explicit expression for tumor suppression and oncogenicity."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event aconitase", "id": "-5666664046229506531", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aconitase", "id": "599756744253777285", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aconitase", "id": "-8336222287245681372", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aconitase", "id": "-296478998971946620", "answers": [{"text": 548, "answer_start": "bind"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Steric and conformational features of the aconitase mechanism. \nCrystal structures of mitochondrial aconitase with alpha-methylisocitrate and with sulfate bound have been solved and refined at 2.0 A resolution with R factors of 18.2 and 16.8%, respectively. The steric factors and conformational effects observed in both new structures support the proposed mechanism for the overall reaction catalyzed by aconitase. The alternate substrate alpha-methylisocitrate is derived from alpha-methyl-cis-aconitate during crystallization and is observed to bind in the active site in a manner very similar to that observed for isocitrate. The methyl group is accommodated by favorable contact with Ile-425. However, the other potential hydration product of alpha-methyl-cis-aconitate, alpha-methylcitrate, cannot be accommodated in the active site due to steric conflict of the methyl group with Asp-165. The results are consistent with the requirement that cis-aconitate must bind in two ways, in the citrate mode and in the isocitrate mode. Crystals of aconitase with sulfate bound are isomorphous to those with isocitrate bound. However, the structure displays significant conformational changes, providing a model for the substrate-free state of enzyme. Three water molecules bind in place of the C alpha- and C beta-hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of isocitrate, while sulfate binds in place of the C gamma-carboxyl group. Side chains of Ser-642 and Arg-447 in the active site rotate to pair with other side chains in the absence of substrate. The new conformation of Arg-447 triggers a concerted set of shifts which transmits conformational change to the surface of the protein, 30 A from the active site. In the absence of substrate, a chain segment containing the [4Fe-4S] ligand Cys-358 also shifts, resulting in the net translation and reorientation of the Fe-S cluster."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Toll-like receptor 1", "id": "-5352535801597281167", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll-like receptor", "id": "5246333684098813389", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR", "id": "1911192224581169417", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR", "id": "-7663577520710829876", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR1", "id": "-8027067792024781217", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR1", "id": "-1128007876169602034", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-5938986123056331207", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR", "id": "2796721380170242199", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR1", "id": "8994230606905474159", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-143680294720172657", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event LpxA", "id": "1343267927575719012", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event LpxA", "id": "-5267032258512498480", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-7494881220773172054", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR1", "id": "-3211547971763462002", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 2", "id": "-4650057597162762958", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR1", "id": "-8657615659242174039", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-8352066239467381602", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLRs", "id": "-2943485464799867784", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Toll", "id": "-8212277474427452969", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR1", "id": "-103390555794040478", "answers": [{"text": 1047, "answer_start": "cooperation"}, {"text": 497, "answer_start": "express"}, {"text": 370, "answer_start": "expressed"}, {"text": 288, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-4945202351411539112", "answers": [{"text": 444, "answer_start": "express"}, {"text": 497, "answer_start": "express"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Evidence for an accessory protein function for Toll-like receptor 1 in anti-bacterial responses. \nMembers of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family are components of the mammalian anti-microbial response, signaling with a domain closely related to that of IL-1 receptors. In this report the expression and function of TLR1, a TLR of unknown function, are examined. TLR1 is expressed by monocytes, as demonstrated using a novel mAb. Monocytes also express TLR2. TLR1 transfection of HeLa cells, which express neither TLR1 nor TLR2, was not sufficient to confer responsiveness to several microbial extracts. However, cotransfection of TLR1 and TLR2 resulted in enhanced signaling by HeLa cells to soluble factors released from Neisseria meningitidis relative to the response with either TLR alone. This phenomenon was also seen with high concentrations of some preparations of LPS. The N. meningitidis factors recognized by TLR1/TLR2 were not released by N. meningitidis mutant in the LpxA gene. Although LpxA is required for LPS biosynthesis, because cooperation between TLR1 and TLR2 was not seen with all LPS preparations, the microbial component(s) TLR1/2 recognizes is likely to be a complex of LPS and other molecules or a compound metabolically and chemically related to LPS. The functional IL-1R consists of a heterodimer; this report suggests a similar mechanism for TLR1 and TLR2, for certain agonists.

Although many tumors have been reported to show disruption of the p53/MDM2/p14ARF pathway, few studies have examined p53, MDM2, and p14ARF simultaneously in colorectal carcinoma. The present study was undertaken to clarify whether correlations exist among MDM2, p53, and p14ARF in colorectal cancer. METHODS: We determined the presence of mutations in the p53 gene, MDM2 expression, and methylation status of the p14ARF in 97 primary colorectal carcinoma specimens. Associations with survival and clinicopathologic factors were investigated. RESULTS: At least one abnormality of these three molecules was found in 82 (84 percent) tumors. We observed a significant inverse association between MDM2 expression and tumor invasion (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the presence of liver metastasis was also significantly associated with low MDM2 expression (P = 0.02).

Here, we show that an MAR binding protein SMAR1 interacts with MDM2 and the Ser15 phosphorylated form of p53, forming a ternary complex in the post stress-recovery phase. This triple complex formation between p53, MDM2 and SMAR1 results in recruitment of HDAC1 to deacetylate p53. The deacetylated p53 binds poorly to the target promoter (p21), which results in switching off the p53 response, essential for re-entry into the cell cycle. Interestingly, the knock-down of SMAR1 using siRNA leads to a prolonged cell-cycle arrest in the post stress recovery phase due to ablation of p53-MDM2-HDAC1 interaction. Thus, the results presented here for the first time highlight the role of SMAR1 in masking the active phosphorylation site of p53, enabling the deacetylation of p53 by HDAC1-MDM2 complex, thereby regulating the p53 transcriptional response during stress rescue."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event TLR2", "id": "3294963738001986847", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR4", "id": "6863756208447322235", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "1861162313450065017", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-2020098821176291232", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR4", "id": "-5684819748184600528", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-5339196490914009177", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "8563017785056847780", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR4", "id": "4271707803269910490", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-2253548089514581830", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR4", "id": "-6803885155571272797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR2", "id": "-3110824195468757679", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TLR4", "id": "-497388705042023764", "answers": [{"text": 159, "answer_start": "implicated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2", "id": "-3217165894200960559", "answers": [{"text": 159, "answer_start": "implicated"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Differential roles of TLR2 and TLR4 in recognition of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cell wall components. \nToll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 are implicated in the recognition of various bacterial cell wall components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

We further show that the initial binding of the Sir2/Sir4 complex to DNA sites that nucleate silencing, accompanied by partial Sir2-dependent histone deacetylation, occurs independently of Sir3 and is likely to be the first step in assembly of silent chromatin at the HM loci and telomeres. The enzymatic activity of Sir2 is not required for this initial binding, but is required for the association of silencing proteins with regions distal from nucleation sites. At the rDNA repeats, we show that histone H3 and H4 tails are required for silencing and rDNA-associated H4 is hypoacetylated in a Sir2-dependent manner.

Here we show that Rb associates with the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase ASK1 in response to specific apoptotic signals. An LXCXE motif on ASK1 was required for Rb binding; this correlated with increased E2F1 transcriptional activity and up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein p73. Overexpression of Rb inhibited ASK1-induced apoptosis; in addition, an ASK1 mutant incapable of binding Rb could not induce apoptosis, indicating that ASK1 has to overcome the antiapoptotic properties of Rb to kill cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that in asynchronous cells the p73P1 promoter is occupied predominantly by E2F3; upon tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulation, E2F3 is dissociated from the promoter and replaced by E2F1. At the same time, TNF-alpha stimulation causes Rb to dissociate from the p73P1 promoter. These are promoter-specific events because Rb binds to the mitogenic cdc25A promoter upon TNF-alpha stimulation.

LiCl, an established inhibitor of GSK-3, sensitized primary rat hepatocytes toward TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis resulting in 90% cell death after 24 h. This was accompanied by increased caspase 8-like and 3-like activities, nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering. LiCl treatment had no effect on IkappaB-alpha degradation, IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity, NF-kappaB binding activity, and p65 nuclear import and export, but decreased transcription of the NF-kappaB-dependent inducible nitric oxide synthase gene and a NF-kappaB-driven reporter gene.

The NF-kappa B transcription factor regulates genes involved in apoptotic, immune, and inflammatory responses. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that NF-kappa B is activated following ODC inhibition. We found that the inhibition of ODC by alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) resulted in a approximately 50% decrease in intracellular putrescine levels within 1 h. NF-kappa B is activated by DFMO through the degradation of the inhibitory protein I kappa B alpha that sequesters NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm. The DFMO-induced NF-kappa B complexes contain the p65 and p50 members of the Rel protein family. DFMO-induced NF-kappa B activation was accompanied by the translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. DFMO selectively inhibited a gene reporter construct dependent on the kappa B site present in the HLA-B7 gene. In contrast, DFMO had no effect on a gene reporter construct dependent on the kappa B site present in the interleukin-8 gene.

Cellular depletion of mdm2 was reproducible in p53-null cells transfected with the HCMV IE2-86 protein, but not with IE172, independently of the endogenous mdm2 promoter.

Short interfering RNA-mediated depletion of IE2-86 restored the ability of HCMV-infected cells to accumulate mdm2 in response to proteasome inhibition.

Here we show that Msg5 DSP activity is essential for maintaining a low level of signaling through the cell integrity pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Consistent with a role of this phosphatase on cell wall physiology, cells lacking Msg5 displayed an increased sensitivity to the cell wall-interfering compound Congo Red. We have observed that the N-terminal non-catalytic region of this phosphatase was responsible for binding to the kinase domain of Slt2, the MAPK that operates in this pathway. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that both proteins act on each other. Msg5 bound and dephosphorylated activated Slt2. Reciprocally, Slt2 phosphorylated Msg5 as a consequence of the activation of the cell integrity pathway. In addition, alternative use of translation initiation sites at MSG5 resulted in two protein forms that are functional on Slt2 and became equally phosphorylated following activation of this MAPK. Under activating conditions, a decrease in the affinity between Msg5 and Slt2 was observed, leading us to suggest that the mechanism by which Slt2 controls the action of Msg5 was via the modulation of protein-protein interactions.

However, the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between inflammation and proliferation of cancer cells remain poorly defined. Here we reported the inhibitory effects of oroxylin A on the inflammation-stimulated proliferation of tumor cells and delineated the mechanism of its action. The results indicated that treatment with oroxylin A inhibited NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and IKKalpha/beta in both human colon tumor HCT116 cells and human monocytes THP-1 cells. In addition, in THP-1 cells, oroxylin A significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of prototypical proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 but not IL-1beta, and it was confirmed at the transcription level. Moreover, oroxylin A inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells stimulated by LPS-induced THP-1 cells in co-culture microenvironment. In summary, oroxylin A modulated NF-kappaB signaling pathway involved in inflammation-induced cancer initiation and progression and therefore could be a potential cancer chemoprevention agent for inflammation-related cancer.

Deregulation of the Rb-E2F1 pathway also results in the activation of p53 and the promotion of apoptosis, and this contributes to the suppression of tumor development. Here, we describe a novel connection between E2F1 and the ATM DNA damage response pathway. In primary human fibroblasts lacking functional ATM, the ability of E2F1 to induce the phosphorylation of p53 and apoptosis is impaired. In contrast, ATM status has no effect on transcriptional activation of target genes or the stimulation of DNA synthesis by E2F1. Cells containing mutant Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein (NBS1), a component of the Mre11-Rad50 DNA repair complex, also have attenuated p53 phosphorylation and apoptosis in response to E2F1 expression. Moreover, E2F1 induces ATM- and NBS1-dependent phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Chk2 at Thr68, a phosphorylation site that stimulates Chk2 activity. Delayed gammaH2AX phosphorylation and absence of ATM autophosphorylation at Ser1981 suggest that E2F1 stimulates ATM through a unique mechanism that is distinct from agents that cause DNA double-strand breaks.

This treatment resulted in significant myotube hypertrophy (protein/DNA) and increased RNA content (RNA/DNA) with no changes in DNA content or indices of cell proliferation. During myotube hypertrophy, the increase in RNA content was accompanied by an increase in tumor suppressor protein retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation and a corresponding increase in the availability of the ribosomal DNA transcription factor upstream binding factor (UBF). Serum stimulation also induced an increase in cyclin D1 protein expression in the differentiated myotubes with a concomitant increase in cyclin D1-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-4 activity toward Rb. The increases in myotube hypertrophy and RNA content were blocked by rapamycin treatment, which also prevented the increase in cyclin D1 protein expression, CDK-4 activity, Rb phosphorylation, and the increase in UBF availability. Our findings demonstrate that activation of mTOR is necessary for myotube hypertrophy and suggest that the role of mTOR is in part to modulate cyclin D1-dependent CDK-4 activity in the regulation of Rb and ribosomal RNA synthesis.

The MDM2-p53 complex is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer cells with intact tumor suppressor p53, as it offers the possibility of releasing p53 by blocking the MDM2-p53 binding site with a small molecule antagonist to promote apoptosis. Isoindolinones are a novel class of MDM2-antagonists of moderate affinity, which still require the development of more potent candidates for clinical applications. As the applicability of conventional structural methods to this system is limited by a number of fundamental factors, the exploitation of the information contained in chemical shift perturbations has offered a useful route to obtaining structural information to guide the development of more potent compounds. For a set of 12 structurally related isoindolinones, the data suggests 4 different orientations of binding, caused by subtle changes in the chemical structure of the inhibitors."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Rfx1", "id": "7651951314773215748", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Crt1", "id": "3359030655339436304", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Crt1", "id": "4749290915024839244", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ribonucleotide reductase", "id": "-414106944646803401", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Crt1", "id": "-8666434903981053294", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Crt1", "id": "-9191355618327917806", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Crt1", "id": "-7829194158542247453", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event histone deacetylases", "id": "8592204114982999514", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HDACs", "id": "604316392050848599", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event HDACs", "id": "-1605803880127828190", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Crt1", "id": "1967939999830783039", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Crt1", "id": "5753326914156510490", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event RNR", "id": "1833913360482043753", "answers": [{"text": 193, "answer_start": "repress"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Crt1", "id": "1503594161854334546", "answers": [{"text": 1774, "answer_start": "dependent"}, {"text": 1035, "answer_start": "bind"}, {"text": 790, "answer_start": "dependent"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TFIID", "id": "1486548658122538475", "answers": [{"text": 1643, "answer_start": "recruitment"}, {"text": 1035, "answer_start": "bind"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Molecular genetic analysis of the yeast repressor Rfx1/Crt1 reveals a novel two-step regulatory mechanism. \nIn Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the repressor Crt1 and the global corepressor Ssn6-Tup1 repress the DNA damage-inducible ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) genes. Initiation of DNA damage signals causes the release of Crt1 and Ssn6-Tup1 from the promoter, coactivator recruitment, and derepression of transcription, indicating that Crt1 plays a crucial role in the switch between gene repression and activation. Here we have mapped the functional domains of Crt1 and identified two independent repression domains and a region required for gene activation. The N terminus of Crt1 is the major repression domain, it directly binds to the Ssn6-Tup1 complex, and its repression activities are dependent upon Ssn6-Tup1 and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In addition, we identified a C-terminal repression domain, which is independent of Ssn6-Tup1 and HDACs and functions at native genes in vivo. Furthermore, we show that TFIID and SWI/SNF bind to a region within the N terminus of Crt1, overlapping with but distinct from the Ssn6-Tup1 binding and repression domain, suggesting that Crt1 may have activator functions. Crt1 mutants were constructed to dissect its activator and repressor functions. All of the mutants were competent for repression of the DNA damage-inducible genes, but a majority were \"derepression-defective\" mutants. Further characterization of these mutants indicated that they are capable of receiving DNA damage signals and releasing the Ssn6-Tup1 complex from the promoter but are selectively impaired for TFIID and SWI/SNF recruitment. These results imply a two-step activation model of the DNA damage-inducible genes and that Crt1 functions as a signal-dependent dual-transcription activator and repressor that acts in a transient manner."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event TAK1", "id": "-8964721389969465079", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ubiquitin", "id": "6133810866524472485", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "-4081041698302823814", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event JNK", "id": "207187283460209911", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event interleukin-1", "id": "619107710957922566", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IL-1", "id": "1813611172442070890", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "-2803605907083856038", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6-regulated IKK activator 1", "id": "157641043849305063", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRIKA1", "id": "-3903470394136493753", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRIKA2", "id": "-7388081522955844868", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ubiquitin", "id": "-842098743723843236", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ubc13", "id": "6620340910359208285", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Uev1A", "id": "246310265026707810", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Mms2", "id": "2647073969078233407", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "597503584390973562", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TAK1", "id": "-5726786497168209136", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TAB1", "id": "9221012129191614783", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TAB2", "id": "-7165154382960772244", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TAK1", "id": "9117910797573836148", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "-1296908706143246873", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event JNK", "id": "6460711462570441866", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p38", "id": "-8653123407025150318", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TRAF6", "id": "2093507305134256191", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event polyubiquitin", "id": "8406674284463254262", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event JNK", "id": "1875269930616250398", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MKK", "id": "-6897489011547870388", "answers": [{"text": 30, "answer_start": "kinase"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Jun amino-terminal kinase", "id": "-6798626887447705165", "answers": [{"text": 88, "answer_start": "activates"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event polyubiquitin", "id": "-1158688933244342863", "answers": [{"text": 555, "answer_start": "formation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event MKK6", "id": "-4358504644621228060", "answers": [{"text": 1044, "answer_start": "phosphorylate"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TAK1", "id": "-9030863739087191683", "answers": [{"text": 1144, "answer_start": "polyubiquitination"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "TAK1 is a ubiquitin-dependent kinase of MKK and IKK. \nTRAF6 is a signal transducer that activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) and Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) in response to pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). IKK activation by TRAF6 requires two intermediary factors, TRAF6-regulated IKK activator 1 (TRIKA1) and TRIKA2 (ref. 5). TRIKA1 is a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex composed of Ubc13 and Uev1A (or the functionally equivalent Mms2). This Ubc complex, together with TRAF6, catalyses the formation of a Lys 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chain that mediates IKK activation through a unique proteasome-independent mechanism. Here we report the purification and identification of TRIKA2, which is composed of TAK1, TAB1 and TAB2, a protein kinase complex previously implicated in IKK activation through an unknown mechanism. We find that the TAK1 kinase complex phosphorylates and activates IKK in a manner that depends on TRAF6 and Ubc13-Uev1A. Moreover, the activity of TAK1 to phosphorylate MKK6, which activates the JNK-p38 kinase pathway, is directly regulated by K63-linked polyubiquitination. We also provide evidence that TRAF6 is conjugated by the K63 polyubiquitin chains.

The expression of this enzyme is induced during the G(1)/S transition of the cell cycle. We identified and monitored the E2F-pocket protein complexes that bind to the E2F site of the F-type promoter during cell-cycle entry, and we analysed their contribution to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-mediated regulation of the promoter. We found that the predominant E2F complex bound to the F-type promoter in unstimulated/quiescent cells contains E2F4, DP1 and p130 proteins. In serum-stimulated (S-phase) cells, the composition of the complex switched to E2F1/4, DP1 and p107, together with cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. Treatment with the PI 3-kinase specific inhibitor LY 294002 prevented the formation of the S-phase complex, suggesting that activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway is essential for the formation of this complex. Further supporting this idea, we obtained results showing that treatment of cycling NIH 3T3 cells with either wortmannin or LY 294002 induces the accumulation of the transcriptionally repressive p130-E2F4-DP1 complex. Using the Rat-1 ER-E2F1 cell line where E2F1 activity can be conditionally induced, we demonstrated that E2F activity is involved in the in vivo transcriptional regulation of the F-type 6PF2K/Fru-2, 6-BPase gene. Taken together, our results show that the F-type 6PF2K/Fru-2, 6-BPase is a genuine E2F-regulated gene, and that its regulation by the PI 3-kinase pathway is at least partially mediated through the E2F transcription factor."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event p53", "id": "-2458039358285742232", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-4188781295415820881", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "4261215793885988033", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "215878774640184793", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "8217903125018405789", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "-6557934709483238375", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "314786400267991798", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-7487607523430300422", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "4062696325237853575", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "5848806731925210367", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p21", "id": "-2394357562345485439", "answers": [{"text": 965, "answer_start": "binds"}, {"text": 1247, "answer_start": "induction"}, {"text": 1533, "answer_start": "induction"}, {"text": 1101, "answer_start": "induction"}, {"text": 224, "answer_start": "induction"}, {"text": 953, "answer_start": "induced"}, {"text": 0, "answer_start": "Induction"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Cdk4", "id": "-2507649770650037410", "answers": [{"text": 1307, "answer_start": "inhibition"}, {"text": 1609, "answer_start": "inhibits"}, {"text": 330, "answer_start": "inhibition"}, {"text": 915, "answer_start": "inhibit"}, {"text": 45, "answer_start": "inhibits"}, {"text": 743, "answer_start": "inhibit"}, {"text": 1173, "answer_start": "inhibition"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Cdk2", "id": "-7332226610595851771", "answers": [{"text": 255, "answer_start": "inhibition"}, {"text": 1307, "answer_start": "inhibition"}, {"text": 1609, "answer_start": "inhibits"}, {"text": 915, "answer_start": "inhibit"}, {"text": 45, "answer_start": "inhibits"}, {"text": 743, "answer_start": "inhibit"}, {"text": 1173, "answer_start": "inhibition"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p53", "id": "-7391525527959957233", "answers": [{"text": 1228, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Induction of p21 by p53 following DNA damage inhibits both Cdk4 and Cdk2 activities. \nDNA damage often activates the p53-p21 pathway and causes G(1)-phase arrest in mammalian cells. Although there is ample evidence that p21 induction by p53 leads to Cdk2 inhibition, it is unclear whether this checkpoint event also leads to Cdk4 inhibition. Diaminocyclohexane(trans-diacetato)(dichloro) platinum(IV) (DAP), a platinum-based coordination complex, is a DNA-damaging agent that is effective against a variety of tumor cells resistant to the parental drug cisplatin. Our previous studies established that treatment of human cancer cells with low effective concentrations of DAP specifically activates the G(1)-phase checkpoint and simultaneously inhibit Cdk4 and Cdk2 activities. Here we demonstrate that DAP treatment of human cancer cells activates the p53-p21 pathway without activating other known mechanisms that inhibit Cdk4 and Cdk2 activities. The induced p21 binds to both the Cdk4/cyclin D and Cdk2/cyclin E complexes and inhibits both of their kinase activities. Conversely, inhibition of p21 induction by cycloheximide or by p21 gene deletion prevents DAP-induced inhibition of Cdk4 and Cdk2 activities. Attenuated p53 expression and p21 induction also eliminates DAP-induced G(1)-phase arrest and inhibition of Cdk4 and Cdk2 activities. Together, these findings establish that activation of the p53-p21 pathway is responsible for the DAP-induced G(1)-phase checkpoint response and provide the first solid evidence that p21 induction by p53 during a DNA damage-induced G(1)-phase checkpoint response inhibits both Cdk4 and Cdk2 activities."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase", "id": "-4070787488432792029", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho", "id": "-4673438232741985817", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PIP5K", "id": "-5337397610573313462", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho", "id": "-3643089840904425791", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho-GST", "id": "-5895556182785700543", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PIP5K", "id": "2056732099328631304", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho-GST", "id": "-4181961491061093884", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Ras-GST", "id": "7932569865246346744", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event GST", "id": "7106966154090506359", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PIP5K", "id": "8074862885710071686", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho-GST", "id": "-1647205422258245630", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho", "id": "-7249741568244623573", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PIP5K", "id": "-3982563036569911688", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho", "id": "7822410670007728212", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PIP5K", "id": "-5281100604120477389", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PIP5K", "id": "820431939431066797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho", "id": "3722849373383257064", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event C3", "id": "9192272049989974670", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho", "id": "-6836840629828038402", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho", "id": "2441517339735097706", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rho", "id": "7878206946501840311", "answers": [{"text": 615, "answer_start": "bound"}, {"text": 9, "answer_start": "association"}, {"text": 1040, "answer_start": "interacts"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase", "id": "4740397603425840245", "answers": [{"text": 209, "answer_start": "stimulated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PIP5K", "id": "6870955193993001112", "answers": [{"text": 508, "answer_start": "bound"}, {"text": 776, "answer_start": "responded"}, {"text": 759, "answer_start": "associated"}, {"text": 1119, "answer_start": "binding"}, {"text": 1287, "answer_start": "interacts"}, {"text": 346, "answer_start": "interacts"}, {"text": 546, "answer_start": "binding"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Physical association of the small GTPase Rho with a 68-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase in Swiss 3T3 cells. \nOur previous work showed that post-translationally modified Rho in its GTP-bound state stimulated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) activity in mouse fibroblast lysates. To investigate whether Rho physically interacts with PIP5K, we incubated immobilized Rho-GST with Swiss 3T3 cell lysates and tested for retained PIP5K activity. Rho-GST, but not Ras-GST or GST alone, bound significant PIP5K activity. The binding of PIP5K was independent of whether Rho was in a GTP- or GDP-bound state. An antibody against a 68-kDa human erythrocyte type I PIP5K recognized a single 68-kDa protein eluted from Rho-GST column. The Rho-associated PIP5K responded to phosphatidic acid differentially from the erythrocyte type I PIP5K, suggesting that it could be a distinct isoform not reported previously. Rho co-immunoprecipitated with the 68-kDa PIP5K from Swiss 3T3 lysates, demonstrating that endogenous Rho also interacts with PIP5K. ADP-ribosylation of Rho with C3 exoenzyme enhanced PIP5K binding by approximately eightfold, consistent with the ADP-ribosylated Rho functioning as a dominant negative inhibitor. These results demonstrate that Rho physically interacts with a 68-kDa PIP5K, although whether the association is direct or indirect is unknown."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event septin", "id":

phosphorylation of Cdc28 protein kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. \nSuccessful mitosis requires faithful DNA replication, spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cell division. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the G(2)-to-M transition requires activation of Clb-bound forms of the protein kinase, Cdc28. These complexes are held in an inactive state via phosphorylation of Tyr19 in the ATP-binding loop of Cdc28 by the Swe1 protein kinase. The HSL1 and HSL7 gene products act as negative regulators of Swe1. Hsl1 is a large (1,518-residue) protein kinase with an N-terminal catalytic domain and a very long C-terminal extension. Hsl1 localizes to the incipient site of cytokinesis in the bud neck in a septin-dependent manner; however, the function of Hsl7 was not previously known. Using both indirect immunofluorescence with anti-Hsl7 antibodies and a fusion of Hsl7 to green fluorescent protein, we found that Hsl7 also localizes to the bud neck, congruent with the septin ring that faces the daughter cell. Both Swe1 and a segment of the C terminus of Hsl1 (which has no sequence counterpart in two Hsl1-related protein kinases, Gin4 and Kcc4) were identified as gene products that interact with Hsl7 in a two-hybrid screen of a random S. cerevisiae cDNA library. Hsl7 plus Swe1 and Hsl7 plus Hsl1 can be coimmunoprecipitated from extracts of cells overexpressing these proteins, confirming that Hsl7 physically associates with both partners. Also consistent with the two-hybrid results, Hsl7 coimmunoprecipitates with full-length Hsl1 less efficiently than with a C-terminal fragment of Hsl1. Moreover, Hsl7 does not localize to the bud neck in an hsl1Delta mutant, whereas Hsl1 is localized normally in an hsl7Delta mutant. Phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation of Swe1, preludes to its destruction, are severely reduced in cells lacking either Hsl1 or Hsl7 (or both), as judged by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Collectively, these data suggest that formation of the septin rings provides sites for docking Hsl1, exposing its C terminus and thereby permitting recruitment of Hsl7. Hsl7, in turn, presents its cargo of bound Swe1, allowing phosphorylation by Hsl1. Thus, Hsl1 and Hsl7 promote proper timing of cell cycle progression by coupling septin ring assembly to alleviation of Swe1-dependent inhibition of Cdc28. Furthermore, like septins and Hsl1, homologs of Hsl7 are found in fission yeast, flies, worms, and humans, suggesting that its function in this control mechanism may be conserved in all eukaryotes."},

signaling component of multiple NF-kappaB activation pathways. \nReceptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) is a member of the RIP kinase family that has been shown to be crucially involved in

The physiological and pathological roles of RIP2 are mediated through its involvement in multiple NF-kappaB activation pathways, including those triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR3, TLR4 and Nod1. In this report, we identified the LIM-domain-containing protein TRIP6 as a RIP2-interacting protein in yeast two-hybrid screens. In mammalian cells, TRIP6 interacts with RIP2 in a TNF- or IL-1-dependent manner. Overexpression of TRIP6 potentiates RIP2-mediated NF-kappaB activation in a dose-dependent manner. The LIM domains of TRIP6 are responsible for its interaction with RIP2. TRIP6 also interacts with TRAF2, a protein that is crucially involved in TNF signaling, as well as the IL-1 receptor, TLR2 and Nod1. Overexpression of TRIP6 potentiates NF-kappaB activation by TNF, IL-1, TLR2 or Nod1, whereas a dominant negative mutant or RNA-interference construct of TRIP6 inhibits NF-kappaB activation by TNF, IL-1, TLR2 or Nod1. Moreover, TRIP6 also potentiates RIP2- and Nod1-mediated ERK activation. These data have established a physical and functional association between TRIP6 and RIP2, and suggest that RIP2's involvement in multiple NF-kappaB and ERK activation pathways is mediated through TRIP6."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event p105", "id": "8099069714003644744", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "-8045538657469245184", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event c-Rel", "id": "-3292287741230339523", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "4032163139233849102", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "-8667190224028605451", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "3479065612412829935", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "6822130380372228779", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rel", "id": "2271382802489447647", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rel", "id": "8495514049577599440", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "451508033194173606", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "-6017645249379741029", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "1362730284744650878", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event v-Rel", "id": "7955419488288170069", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event v-Rel", "id": "-5545966073889829575", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p124", "id": "1200764297435376181", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p115", "id": "8144336517873076356", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "4289195679586713235", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p124", "id": "-8360285204125130650", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event v-Rel", "id": "-3056014232529026721", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "4505072069952087995", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p124", "id": "4687032167945850828", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event V8", "id": "-895290509947589047", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event v-Rel", "id": "-7893068914759078715", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event v-Rel", "id": "-6098554542101492623", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event v-Rel", "id": "-6272712215629039960", "answers": [{"text": 76, "answer_start": "complexed"}, {"text": 1372, "answer_start": "complex"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p105", "id": "-2579117287838797964", "answers": [{"text": 1372, "answer_start": "complex"}, {"text": 1572, "answer_start": "associate"}, {"text": 1446, "answer_start": "association"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "5497662268446050728", "answers": [{"text": 1372, "answer_start": "complex"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event c-Rel", "id": "2849025049938367156", "answers": [{"text": 1372, "answer_start": "complex"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "p105, the NF-kappa B p50 precursor protein, is one of the cellular proteins complexed with the v-Rel oncoprotein in transformed chicken spleen cells. \nActive NF-kappa B-like transcription complexes are multimers consisting of one or two members of a family of proteins related to the c-Rel proto-oncoprotein. We have isolated a chicken cDNA encoding p105, the precursor protein for the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B. Sequence analysis shows that chicken p105 is approximately 70% identical to the mouse and human p105 proteins, containing the Rel homology domain in its N-terminal 370 amino acids and several ankyrinlike repeats in the C-terminal portion of the protein. The Rel homology domain is particularly highly conserved between chicken and mammalian p50, and an in vitro-synthesized, truncated chicken p105 protein, containing sequences that correspond to the predicted p50 protein, bound to a consensus kappa B site in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Previous studies in rat hepatocytes suggested that organic anion uptake is associated with base exchange. To better characterize the mechanism of oatp-mediated organic anion uptake, we examined transport of taurocholate in a HeLa cell line stably transfected with oatp under the regulation of a zinc-inducible promoter (Shi, X., Bai, S., Ford, A. C., Burk, R. D., Jacquemin, E., Hagenbuch, B., Meier, P. J., and Wolkoff, A. W. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25591-25595). Whereas noninduced transfected cells showed virtually no uptake of [3H]taurocholate, taurocholate uptake by induced cells was Na+-independent and saturable (Km = 19.4 +/- 3.3 microM; Vmax = 62.2 +/- 1.4 pmol/min/mg protein; n = 3). To test whether organic anion transport is coupled to HCO3- extrusion, we compared the rates of taurocholate-dependent HCO3- efflux from alkali-loaded noninduced and induced cells. Monolayers grown on glass coverslips were loaded with the pH-sensitive dye 2', 7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; intracellular pH (pHi) was measured by excitation ratio fluorometry. Noninduced and induced cells were alkalinized to an equivalent pHi ( approximately 7.7) by transient exposure to a 50 mM HCO3-, Cl--free solution. In the absence of extracellular Cl- and taurocholate, isohydric reduction of superfusate HCO3- concentration from 50 to 25 mM resulted in an insignificant change in pHi over time (dpHi/dt) in both groups. Addition of 25 microM taurocholate to the superfusate led to a rapid fall in pHi in induced (-0.037 +/- 0.011 pH units/min to pHi of 7.41 +/- 0.14) but not in noninduced (0.003 +/- 0.006 pH units/min to pHi of 7.61 +/- 0.08) cells (p < 0.03). These data indicate that oatp-mediated taurocholate transport is Na+-independent, saturable, and accompanied by HCO3- exchange.

In the \"canonical\" Wnt signaling pathway, Disheveled (Dvl) is required to functionally inhibit the activity of the GSK3beta/Axin complex and thereby stabilize beta-catenin. Yet, the mechanisms that underlie Wnt regulation of GSK3 and stabilization of beta-catenin are still not fully appreciated. RESULTS: Here, we examine time-dependent changes in protein-protein interactions that occur in response to Wnt treatment. We show that GSK3beta/Axin complexes are rapidly (t1/2 < 3 min) disrupted upon Wnt stimulation and that changes in GSK3beta/Axin association substantially precede both beta-catenin stabilization and Axin degradation. We further demonstrate that depletion of Galpha(o) or Galpha(q) will inhibit, respectively, the Wnt-induced disruption of GSK3beta/Axin2 and GSK3beta/Axin complexes and diminish Wnt stabilization of beta-catenin. We also show that direct activation of G proteins in vivo with GTPgammaS in the absence of exogenous Wnt will disrupt GSK3beta/Axin2 complexes and stabilize beta-catenin. Finally, we demonstrate an association of Galpha(o) with Fz that is also very rapidly (t1/2 < 1 min) perturbed upon Wnt-3a stimulation and that the Wnt-dependent effects on both GSK3beta/Axin2 and Galpha(o)/Fz are pertussis-toxin sensitive. Collectively, these data implicate a role for G proteins in the regulation of Wnt-mediated protein-protein interactions and signaling to beta-catenin. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that rapid disruption of GSK3beta/Axin interactions in response to Wnt leads to the initial stabilization of beta-catenin and that Galpha(o) and Galpha(q) signaling contributes to Wnt-mediated GSK3beta/Axin disruption and the ultimate stabilization of beta-catenin."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event DPF3a", "id": "-4186250727307771073", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event -3b", "id": "4383112177691677947", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DPF2", "id": "-1427024440854440156", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event requiem", "id": "-3927159741917583326", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event REQ", "id": "-394868698217365079", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event RelA", "id": "6041480672093656214", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "-4314963289116652915", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "4195848543472717578", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DPF3a", "id": "5915843076388312318", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event b", "id": "7732798422217587202", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event LTR", "id": "6355996323436889017", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "4275894153314447153", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DPF3a", "id": "-6781379753941173609", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event b", "id": "5855704058899970708", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event IL-6", "id": "-793253413749909823", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "2091221763104603388", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DPF3a", "id": "-4355448154181064872", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event b", "id": "-491939780608487891", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event DPF2", "id": "-6879178023241524730", "answers": [{"text": 751, "answer_start": "express"}, {"text": 549, "answer_start": "overexpression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event PHF10", "id": "5737204811739595615", "answers": [{"text": 751, "answer_start": "express"}, {"text": 549, "answer_start": "overexpression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event DPF3b", "id": "4865529995088272224", "answers": [{"text": 751, "answer_start": "express"}, {"text": 840, "answer_start": "produced"}, {"text": 1124, "answer_start": "interact"}, {"text": 549, "answer_start": "overexpression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event DPF1", "id": "5723325623299504989", "answers": [{"text": 751, "answer_start": "express"}, {"text": 549, "answer_start": "overexpression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event DPF3a", "id": "2958060537681892366", "answers": [{"text": 751, "answer_start": "express"}, {"text": 840, "answer_start": "produced"}, {"text": 1124, "answer_start": "interact"}, {"text": 549, "answer_start": "overexpression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event DPF3", "id": "3749086738091473671", "answers": [{"text": 840, "answer_start": "produced"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event TNF-alpha", "id": "8481693278440867708", "answers": [{"text": 991, "answer_start": "stimulation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event RelA", "id": "-641386606460192313", "answers": [{"text": 1675, "answer_start": "associate"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Double plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins DPF3a and -3b are required as transcriptional co-activators in SWI/SNF complex-dependent activation of NF-kappaB RelA/p50 heterodimer. \nWe have previously shown that DPF2 (requiem/REQ) functions as a linker protein between the SWI/SNF complex and RelB/p52 NF-kappaB heterodimer and plays important roles in NF-kappaB transactivation via its noncanonical pathway. Using sensitive 293FT reporter cell clones that had integrated a SWI/SNF-dependent NF-kappaB reporter gene, we find in this study that the overexpression of DPF1, DPF2, DPF3a, DPF3b, and PHF10 significantly potentiates the transactivating activity of typical NF-kappaB dimers. Knockdown analysis using 293FT reporter cells that endogenously express these five proteins at low levels clearly showed that DPF3a and DPF3b, which are produced from the DPF3 gene by alternative splicing, are the most critical for the RelA/p50 NF-kappaB heterodimer transactivation induced by TNF-alpha stimulation. Our data further show that this transactivation requires the SWI/SNF complex. DPF3a and DPF3b are additionally shown to interact directly with RelA, p50, and several subunits of the SWI/SNF complex in vitro and to be co-immunoprecipitated with RelA/p50 and the SWI/SNF complex from the nuclear fractions of cells treated with TNF-alpha.

Additionally, re-ChIP experiments showed DPF3a/b and the SWI/SNF complex associate with RelA on the endogenous IL-6 promoter after TNF-alpha treatment.

The traditional view of PKCs as DAG/phospholipid-regulated proteins has expanded in the last few years by three seminal discoveries. First, PKC activity and maturation is controlled by autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation mechanisms, which includes phosphorylation of PKC isozymes by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinases (PDKs) and tyrosine kinases. Second, PKC activity and localization are regulated by direct interaction with different types of interacting proteins. Protein-protein interactions are now recognized as important mechanisms that target individual PKCs to different intracellular compartments and confer selectivity by associating individual isozymes with specific substrates.

Here, we show that nimbolide, a triterpenoid isolated from Azadirachta indica, enhanced the apoptosis induced by inflammatory cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents in tumor cells. This limonoid abrogated the expression of proteins associated with cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, IAP-1, and IAP-2), proliferation (cyclin D1), invasion (MMP-9), and angiogenesis (VEGF), all regulated by nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Nimbolide inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB induced by carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli. Constitutively active NF-kappaB found in most tumor cells was also inhibited. We found that suppression of NF-kappaB activation by nimbolide was caused by inhibition of IkappaB kinase (IKK), which led to suppression of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and gene transcription. Reducing agent reversed the action of the limonoid, suggesting the involvement of a cysteine residue. Replacement of Cys(179) of IKK-beta with alanine abolished the effect of nimbolide, suggesting that Cys(179) plays a critical role in inhibiting the NF-kappaB activation.

The question we posed was whether there is a liver-specific regulation of the p53/MDM2 feedback loop and if it can be related to the development of pre-neoplastic lesions, referred to as enzyme altered foci (EAF) in rats. Acute responses of p53 and MDM2 to diethylnitrosamine (DEN) were characterized by employing immunohistochemistry, western blotting, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. A single dose of DEN induced a centrilobular p53 response that peaked at 24 h. It was associated with transcriptional activation of MDM2 and signs of apoptosis. However, in midzonal hepatocytes, which constitutively expressed high levels of cytoplasmic MDM2, there was a rapid-onset but transient p53 response. It was terminated at 24 h and there were no signs of apoptosis. The rapidly declining p53 levels in midzonal areas was preceded by a transient peak in MDM2 mRNA levels at 6 h. Rats pre-treated with repeated low or high weekly doses of DEN exhibited EAF and these lesions expressed high levels of cytoplasmic MDM2. Using MDM2 as a marker for EAF gave similar results as using glutathione transferase-P (GST-P) as a marker. Furthermore, small EAF, elicited by low doses of DEN, were preferentially localized to midzonal areas. It is concluded that in centrilobular areas DEN-induced alterations in p53/MDM2 levels are compatible with a previously described feedback loop. An attenuated p53 response in midzonal hepatocytes can be related to a high constitutive expression of MDM2 in these cells. The localization of small EAF to midzonal areas, and the fact that EAF cells expressed high levels of MDM2, indicates that MDM2 expression is a factor governing initiation and early development of EAF. The data support the hypothesis that EAF hepatocytes are initiated via epigenetic mechanisms."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event claspin", "id": "-7068976058977817765", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Claspin", "id": "-7724844668959959625", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Claspin", "id": "8701717907600408896", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rad9", "id": "9044362167939745683", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event ATR", "id": "4606950937765997101", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Claspin", "id": "987852127387512885", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Chk1", "id": "-260795190349671898", "answers": [{"text": 614, "answer_start": "association"}, {"text": 404, "answer_start": "associates"}, {"text": 782, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 121, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 997, "answer_start": "activation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event Claspin", "id": "4788060309425639316", "answers": [{"text": 508, "answer_start": "phosphorylated"}, {"text": 972, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 367, "answer_start": "localizes"}, {"text": 1061, "answer_start": "down-regulation"}, {"text": 567, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 1295, "answer_start": "role"}, {"text": 655, "answer_start": "interacts"}, {"text": 185, "answer_start": "role"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event ATR", "id": "6918456351801996310", "answers": [{"text": 655, "answer_start": "interacts"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Human claspin is required for replication checkpoint control. \nClaspin is a newly identified protein that regulates Chk1 activation in Xenopus. In the present study we investigated the role of human Claspin in the DNA damage/replication checkpoint in mammalian cells. We observed that human Claspin is a cell cycle regulated protein that peaks at S/G2 phase. Claspin localizes in the nuclei, but it only associates with Chk1 following replication stress or other types of DNA damage. In addition, Claspin is phosphorylated in response to replication stress, and this phosphorylation appears to be required for its association with Chk1. Moreover, Claspin interacts with the checkpoint proteins ATR and Rad9. Given that both the ATR and Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complexes are involved in Chk1 activation, it is possible that Claspin works as an adaptor molecule bringing these molecules together. Using small interfering RNA technology, we have shown that down-regulation of Claspin expression inhibits Chk1 activation in response to replication stress. More importantly, down-regulation of Claspin augments the premature chromatin condensation induced by hydroxyurea, inhibits the UV-induced reduction of DNA synthesis, and decreases cell survival.

Mechanistically, Tnf-alpha stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of histone H3 at the Hes1 promoter, and this signal was lost with Ikk2 deletion. Hes1 suppresses expression of Pparg, which encodes the antiinflammatory nuclear receptor Ppargamma. Thus, crosstalk between Tnf-alpha/Ikk2 and Notch sustains the intrinsic inflammatory profile of transformed cells.

A conserved tyrosine residue (Y88) in the Cdk-binding domain of p27 can be phosphorylated by the Src-family kinase Lyn and the oncogene product BCR-ABL. Y88 phosphorylation does not prevent p27 binding to cyclin A/Cdk2.

Although extremely low levels of p73 expression were observed in all noncancerous gastric tissues and four of five cell lines, a significant elevation of p73 was detected in 37 of 39 (94.9%) carcinoma tissues. Furthermore, a tumor-specific increase of p73 was identified in 14 of 16 (87.5%) matched sets.

Disruption of these phosphorylation sites abrogates checkpoint-mediated regulation of Cdc2 and renders cells highly sensitive to agents that damage DNA. Phosphorylation of these sites is controlled by the opposing activities of the Wee1/Myt1 kinases and the Cdc25 phosphatase. The regulation of these enzymes is therefore likely to be crucial for the operation of the G2-M DNA-damage checkpoint. RESULTS: Here, we show that the activity of Cdc25 decreased following exposure to ionizing radiation. The irradiation-induced decrease in Cdc25 activity was suppressed by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinases, and was dependent on the function of the gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia. We also identified two human kinases that phosphorylate and inactivate Cdc25 in vitro. One is the previously characterized Chk1 kinase. The second is novel and is homologous to the Cds1/Rad53 family of checkpoint kinases in yeast. Human Cds1 was found to be activated in response to DNA damage. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in human cells, the DNA-damage checkpoint involves direct inactivation of Cdc25 catalyzed by Cds1 and/or Chk1."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event Aldose reductase", "id": "6272488574957047766", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldose reductase", "id": "-7823312291117265843", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldehyde reductase", "id": "-5213283170868974231", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldose reductase", "id": "5844401644607804720", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event monoamine oxidase", "id": "6269549922632135056", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAO", "id": "1984709288603926243", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldehyde reductase", "id": "-2666083520217332797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldose reductase", "id": "5662631263751469573", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldose reductase", "id": "3691309927714620029", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldose reductase", "id": "8448267837522701938", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldose reductase", "id": "5454434769231122823", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event MAO", "id": "2155354586382958167", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldose reductase", "id": "2933994836053716539", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldehyde reductase", "id": "-2717809759387843990", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldehyde reductase", "id": "-4768720459496727816", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event aldehyde reductase", "id": "-1012608468817107020", "answers": [{"text": 751, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event aldose reductase", "id": "1961513526043830902", "answers": [{"text": 751, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 1537, "answer_start": "inhibited"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Aldose reductase, a key enzyme in the oxidative deamination of norepinephrine in rats. \nThe sympathoneural neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) is deaminated to 3,4-dihydroxymandelaldehyde (DHMAL) and subsequently converted to either 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA) or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). In this study, we investigated the relative importance of aldose reductase versus aldehyde reductase in the formation of DHPG from DHMAL. The in vitro incubation of NE with aldose reductase in the presence of monoamine oxidase (MAO) resulted in the formation of DHPG, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Although aldehyde reductase also generated DHPG, its activity was much lower than that of aldose reductase. With northern blotting, the expression of both aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase was detected in rat superior cervical ganglia. However, with western blotting, only aldose reductase was immunologically detectable. Treatment of rats with aldose reductase inhibitors for 3 days increased the plasma level of DHMA. There was no correlation between the selectivity of inhibitors and effects on NE metabolite levels. A significant decrease in DHPG, however, was obtained only with an extremely high dose (9 mg/kg/day) of the nonselective inhibitor AL 1576. The present study confirmed that aldose reductase generates DHPG from NE in the presence of MAO. In rat sympathetic neurons, aldose reductase appears to be more important than aldehyde reductase for the formation of DHPG. However, when aldose reductase is inhibited, it appears that aldehyde reductase can compensate for the conversion of DHMAL to DHPG, indicating redundancy in the reduction pathway."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event E2F6", "id": "4239171012715750332", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-4706056478230916584", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2Fs", "id": "-7406937457111022636", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F6", "id": "3860508794362663066", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-7204476849499569585", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "2965041863059403625", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event 5", "id": "-6909497013196399958", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rb", "id": "-2087657940996085407", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Rb", "id": "-8247351804839011030", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Polycomb", "id": "-1542761287903391425", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event PcG", "id": "7738196079949003659", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F6", "id": "5584459064014072164", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F6", "id": "-93501978590293190", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Tex12", "id": "-6035973643700797311", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event alpha-tubulin", "id": "-542693752885681536", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event Tex12", "id": "-4450053558418281433", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "7624092992823475330", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F6", "id": "2356050724856747531", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F6", "id": "-211022024814029745", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F6", "id": "4633651642835342045", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F6", "id": "-298819671759832444", "answers": [{"text": 462, "answer_start": "complex"}, {"text": 684, "answer_start": "deficient"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event alpha-tubulin 3", "id": "-2170782546420647077", "answers": [{"text": 763, "answer_start": "expressed"}, {"text": 712, "answer_start": "express"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event 7", "id": "1523329895926895369", "answers": [{"text": 763, "answer_start": "expressed"}, {"text": 712, "answer_start": "express"}, {"text": 912, "answer_start": "expressed"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event tubulin 3", "id": "-4417885656452476549", "answers": [{"text": 912, "answer_start": "expressed"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event CpG", "id": "-571826091986120137", "answers": [{"text": 1112, "answer_start": "hypermethylation"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "A role for E2F6 in the restriction of male-germ-cell-specific gene expression. \nE2F transcription factors play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and can be subdivided into activating and repressing family members [1].

Instead, E2F6 has been shown to complex with Polycomb (PcG) group proteins [6 and 7], which have a well-established role in gene silencing. Here, we show that E2F6 plays an unexpected and essential role in the tissue specificity of gene expression. E2F6-deficient mice ubiquitously express the alpha-tubulin 3 and 7 genes, which are expressed strictly testis-specifically in control mice. Like an additional E2F6 target gene, Tex12, that we identified, tubulin 3 and 7 are normally expressed in male germ cells only. The promoters of the alpha-tubulin and Tex12 genes share a perfectly conserved E2F site, which E2F6 binds to. Mechanistically, E2F6-mediated repression involves CpG hypermethylation locking target promoters in an inactive state.

The tumor suppressor p53 is an important regulator of NPC apoptosis, but the precise mechanism of p53-regulated cerebellar NPC death remains largely unknown. Here, by using primary cerebellar NPCs and a mouse cerebellar NPC line, we compared the molecular regulation of cerebellar NPC death produced by staurosporine (STS), a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, with that caused by genotoxic agents. We found that both STS- and genotoxin-induced cerebellar NPC death were markedly inhibited by p53 or Bax deficiency. Genotoxin-induced cerebellar NPC death required new protein synthesis and PUMA, a p53 transcriptionally regulated BH3-only molecule. In contrast, STS caused cerebellar NPC death without requiring new protein synthesis or PUMA expression. In addition, genotoxic agents increased nuclear p53 immunoreactivity, whereas STS produced rapid cytoplasmic p53 accumulation. Interestingly, STS-induced death of cerebellar granule neurons was p53-independent, indicating a differentiation-dependent feature of neuronal apoptotic regulation. These results suggest that STS-induced cerebellar NPC death requires a direct effect of p53 on cytoplasmic apoptotic mediators, whereas genotoxin-induced death requires p53-dependent gene transcription of PUMA.

Aberrant Notch signaling has been repeatedly demonstrated to facilitate the proliferation and survival of glioma cells by regulating downstream effectors or other signaling pathways. In glioblastoma multiforme specimens from 59 patients, Notch1 was highly expressed in tumor tissues compared with normal brain tissues, and this expression was correlated with elevated AKT phosphorylation and Snail expression. Increased nuclear localization of beta-catenin and p50 as well as enhanced IKKalpha/AKT interaction were also observed in glioma tissues. In U87MG cells, the activation of Notch1 by DLL4 stimulation or by the overexpression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) resulted in AKT activation and thereby promoted beta-catenin activity and NF-kappaB signaling. Inhibition of EGFR partially blocked the beta-catenin and NF-kappaB signaling stimulated by Notch1 activation. Furthermore, NICD overexpression in U87MG cells led to the upregulated expression of several metastasis-associated molecules, which could be abrogated by the knockdown of either beta-catenin or p50.

For instance in yeast, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Hog1 is activated and inactivated within minutes, even when the osmotic-stress stimulus is sustained. RESULTS: Here, we used a combination of experimental and computational analyses to investigate the dynamic behavior of Hog1 activation in vivo. Computational modeling suggested that a negative-feedback loop operates early in the pathway and leads to rapid attenuation of Hog1 signaling. Experimental analysis revealed that the membrane-bound osmosensor Sho1 is phosphorylated by Hog1 and that phosphorylation occurs on Ser-166. Moreover, Sho1 exists in a homo-oligomeric complex, and phosphorylation by Hog1 promotes a transition from the oligomeric to monomeric state. A phosphorylation-site mutation (Sho1(S166E)) diminishes the formation of Sho1-oligomers, dampens activation of the Hog1 kinase, and impairs growth in high-salt or sorbitol conditions.

We have begun analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying AAV2-mediated onco-suppression through cell cycle regulation in HPV-infected keratinocytes isolated from a low-grade cervical lesion. AAV2 superinfection of HPV type 31b (HPV31b)-positive cells at early times postinfection resulted in degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21(WAF1) protein in a proteosome-dependent manner. Downstream consequences of lowering p21(WAF1) levels included a proportional loss of cyclin E/CDK2 complexes bound to p21(WAF1). The loss of stable p21(WAF1)/cyclin E/CDK2 complexes coincided with an increase in CDK2-associated kinase activity and cyclin E levels. Both events have the potential to enhance the G(1)/S transition point mediated by active cyclin E/CDK2 complexes. Concurrently, cyclin A and E2F levels were decreased, conditions reminiscent of delayed entrance into the S phase of the cell cycle. On the other hand, infection of primary human foreskin keratinocytes with AAV2 resulted in upregulation of p21(WAF1) protein levels, reminiscent of a block in G(1) phase progression. We propose that by down regulating p21(WAF1), AAV2 initiates cell cycle activities leading to enhanced G(1)/S phase-like conditions which may be favorable for AAV2-specific functions and may lead to downstream interference with HPV-associated cervical cancer progression."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event E2F", "id": "-7920277943406584353", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "-2167702465138681530", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "5412219292908748893", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F6", "id": "5116748365541469405", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-2406509774551360604", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-4954289754048713740", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F", "id": "-4066514065544277995", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "2601432713491854733", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event E2F6", "id": "1652483903847522366", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event cytochrome c1", "id": "6298572591858364432", "answers": [{"text": 48, "answer_start": "modulated"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event cytochrome c(1)", "id": "6521604706066561779", "answers": [{"text": 114, "answer_start": "activated"}, {"text": 621, "answer_start": "inhibits"}, {"text": 734, "answer_start": "modulate"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event E2F1", "id": "1043670700719333406", "answers": [{"text": 422, "answer_start": "activation"}, {"text": 160, "answer_start": "expressing"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event DNase I", "id": "-5607512300389198834", "answers": [{"text": 236, "answer_start": "protection"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Activity of the human cytochrome c1 promoter is modulated by E2F. \nThe human cytochrome c(1) promoter is strongly activated in transfected Drosophila SL2 cells expressing exogenous human E2F1.

The complex promotes activation of downstream caspase cascade and induces degradation of IkappaBalpha. Caspases are activated using mechanisms of oligomeration and 'self-controlled proteolysis'. According to their structures and functions, apoptosis related caspases can be divided into upstream and downstream caspases. In general, upstream caspases cleave and activate downstream caspases by proteolysis of the Asp-X site. Activated caspases then cleaved target substrates. To date, more than 70 proteins have been identified to be substrates of caspases in mammalian cells. Caspases can alter the function of their target proteins by destroying structural components of the cytoskeleton and nuclear scaffold or by removing their regulatory domains. Activation of NF-kappaB is dependent on the degradation of IkappaBalpha. IkappaB kinase (IKK) phosphorylates IkappaBalpha at the residues 32 and 36 followed by polyubiquitination at lysine 21 and 22 and subsequent degradation of the molecules by 26S proteasome. There is extensive crosstalk between the apoptotic and NF-kappaB signaling pathways that emanate from TNF-R1. On the one hand, activation of NF-kappaB can inactivate caspases; on the other hand, activated caspases can inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB. Both processes involve in proteolysis.

Histones H3 and H4 simultaneously become hyperacetylated, but it remains unclear whether this is a prerequisite or a consequence of E2F binding. Here, we show that activating E2F species are required for hyperacetylation of target chromatin in human cells. Overexpression of a dominant-negative (DN) E2F1 mutant in serum-stimulated T98G cells blocked all E2F binding, H4 acetylation, and, albeit partially, H3 acetylation. Target gene activation and S-phase entry were also blocked by DN E2F1. Conversely, ectopic activation of E2F1 rapidly induced H3 and H4 acetylation, demonstrating a direct role for E2F in these events. E2F1 was previously shown to bind the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) p300/CBP and PCAF/GCN5. In our hands, ectopically expressed E2F1 also bound the unrelated HAT Tip60 and induced recruitment of five subunits of the Tip60 complex (Tip60, TRRAP, p400, Tip48, and Tip49) to target promoters in vivo. Moreover, E2F-dependent recruitment of Tip60 to chromatin occurred in late G(1) following serum stimulation.

Data presented here suggest a novel RA-signaling, by which RA-induced p21 induction and complex formation with cyclin E/CDK2 diverts CDK2 function from normally driving proliferation to alternatively promoting apoptosis."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event p50", "id": "-7379324924084654888", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF", "id": "-2232116660017844563", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF", "id": "-2771129485792157986", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p65", "id": "-7098905194138627371", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF", "id": "-2741963497304503540", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "-343536238793292661", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF", "id": "8933202014837776863", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p65", "id": "2421587772973263041", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "1070079863230893472", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "7694103859200634827", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event VCAM-1", "id": "3437194741170092800", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "-1677352773881674093", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "-587598069465004654", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "-1531676957706405738", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "-7048859802332914550", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "3346408583720637859", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event TNF", "id": "574964392823087964", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "4454763521650636940", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event VCAM-1", "id": "4227706047652538972", "answers": [{"text": 1623, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 586, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 377, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 115, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 673, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 1749, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 1903, "answer_start": "expression"}, {"text": 211, "answer_start": "r"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event I-kappaBalpha", "id": "-6389395483358254184", "answers": [{"text": 412, "answer_start": "phosphorylation"}, {"text": 443, "answer_start": "degradation"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p50", "id": "4265843635755599401", "answers": [{"text": 1001, "answer_start": "association"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event p65", "id": "6208604817466686903", "answers": [{"text": 1001, "answer_start": "association"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Phosphorylation of p50 NF-kappaB at a single serine residue by DNA-dependent protein kinase is critical for VCAM-1 expression upon TNF treatment. \nThe DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB is critical for VCAM-1 expression during inflammation. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is thought to be involved in NF-kappaB activation. Here we show that DNA-PK is required for VCAM-1 expression in response to TNF. The phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I-kappaBalpha as well as the serine 536 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 NF-kappaB were insufficient for VCAM-1 expression in response to TNF. The requirement for p50 NF-kappaB in TNF-induced VCAM-1 expression may be associated with its interaction with and phosphorylation by DNA-PK, which appears to be dominant over the requirement for p65 NF-kappaB activation. p50 NF-kappaB binding to its consensus sequence increased its susceptibility to phosphorylation by DNA-PK. Additionally, DNA-PK activity appeared to increase the association between p50/p50 and p50/p65 NF-kappaB dimers upon binding to DNA and after binding of p50 NF-kappaB to the VCAM-1 promoter. Analyses of the p50 NF-kappaB protein sequence revealed that both serine 20 and serine 227 at the amino terminus of the protein are putative sites for phosphorylation by DNA-PK. Mutation of serine 20 completely eliminated phosphorylation of p50 NF-kappaB by DNA-PK, suggesting that serine 20 is the only site in p50 NF-kappaB for phosphorylation by DNA-PK. Re-establishing wild-type p50 NF-kappaB, but not its serine 20/alanine mutant, in p50 NF-kappaB(-/-) fibroblasts reversed VCAM-1 expression after TNF treatment, demonstrating the importance of the serine 20 phosphorylation site in the induction of VCAM-1 expression.

The members of the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) subfamily are characterized by three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. They form heterodimeric signaling receptor complexes consisting of receptor and accessory proteins. The members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) subfamily recognize alarm signals that can be derived either from pathogens or the host itself. TLRs possess leucine-rich repeats in their extracellular part. TLRs can form dimeric receptor complexes consisting of two different TLRs or homodimers in the case of TLR4. The TLR4 receptor complex requires supportive molecules for optimal response to its ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A hallmark of the TIR family is the cytoplasmic TIR domain that is indispensable for signal transduction. The TIR domain serves as a scaffold for a series of protein-protein interactions which result in the activation of a unique signaling module consisting of MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) family members and Tollip, which is used exclusively by TIR family members. Subsequently, several central signaling pathways are activated in parallel, the activation of NFkappaB being the most prominent event of the inflammatory response. Recent developments indicate that in addition to the common signaling module MyD88/IRAK/Tollip, other molecules can modulate signaling by TLRs, especially of TLR4, resulting in differential biological answers to distinct pathogenic structures. Subtle differences in TLR signaling pathways are now becoming apparent, which reveal how the innate immune system decides at a very early stage the direction in which the adaptive immune response will develop. The creation of pathogen-specific mediator environments by dendritic cells defines whether a cellular or humoral response will be activated in response to the pathogen."}, {"qas": [{"question": "event alpha-mannosidase", "id": "99238926524454364", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event alpha-mannosidase", "id": "2558310087978470427", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event alpha-mannosidase", "id": "-4834444672951484008", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event mannosidase", "id": "7183294873720172789", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event alpha-mannosidase", "id": "2777628039175812966", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event alpha-mannosidase", "id": "7154035284536343056", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "event alpha-mannosidase", "id": "-4692657734848960166", "answers": [{"text": 766, "answer_start": "inhibited"}, {"text": 141, "answer_start": "expressed"}, {"text": 9, "answer_start": "expression"}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "event EC 3.2.1.24", "id": "-115633346756438605", "answers": [{"text": 766, "answer_start": "inhibited"}, {"text": 141, "answer_start": "expressed"}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of the human broad specificity lysosomal acid alpha-mannosidase. \nWe have cloned and expressed two cDNAs encoding the human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) by RT-PCR of human spleen mRNA.

The NAGS gene is expressed in the liver and small intestine; the intestinal transcript is smaller in size than liver transcript."}, {"qas": [], "context": "Osmium (VI) complexes of the 3', 5'-dinucleoside monophosphates, ApU and UpA. \nThe dinucleoside monophosphates, ApU and UpA, react with potassium osmate (VI) and 2,2'-bipyridyl to form the corresponding oxo-osmium (VI) bipyridyl sugar ester in which the osmate group is bonded to the terminal 2',3'-glycol. Osmium (VIII) tetroxide and 2,2'-bipyridyl react with the dinucleosides to form the corresponding oxo-osmium (VI) bipyridyl heterocyclic esters which result from addition of the tetroxide to the 5,6-double bond of the uracil residue. Although capable of transesterification reactions, these heterocyclic esters are exceptionally stable toward exchange reactions in solution. No apparent exchange was observed after 1 month. This reaction thus seems promising for single-site osmium labeling in polynucleotides."}]}]}
